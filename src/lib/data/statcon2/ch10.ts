	short: 'Ch. X — Amendment, Revision & Repeal',
	sections: '§§10.01–10.41 (section numbers as used in your earlier guide)',

	plain: `Laws change in three ways. They are <b>amended</b> (some words changed), <b>revised or codified</b> (a whole body of law rewritten into one statute), or <b>repealed</b> (ended). Courts do not presume that the legislature changed or ended a law silently, so amendments and repeals by implication are disfavored. And when a law is repealed, what was validly done under it is generally not undone.`,
	overview: `<p><b>Part A (§§10.01–10.10)</b>: how amendments are made, how an amended statute is read, and their effect. <b>Part B (§§10.11–10.15)</b>: revision and codification, and the rule that omitted provisions are deemed repealed, but only when the new code is meant to replace the whole subject (<i>Mecano v. COA</i>). <b>Part C (§§10.16–10.29)</b>: express and implied repeal, the two kinds of implied repeal and their requisites, and the presumption against them. <b>Part D (§§10.30–10.41)</b>: the effects of repeal on jurisdiction, actions, vested rights, contracts, taxes and penal liability, and what happens when a repealing law is itself repealed or annulled.</p>
<p>The chapter is the other side of Chapter VI. Chapter VI says <b>harmonize</b>; Chapter X says what happens when harmony is impossible, and insists that conclusion be reached only on a clear showing. <i>Magtajas</i> and <i>Corona</i> are your case anchors.</p>`,
	questions: [
		'How is a statute amended, and how is an amended statute read?',
		'What happens to provisions left out of a revision or code?',
		'What distinguishes express from implied repeal? Is a general repealing clause an express repeal?',
		'What are the two kinds of implied repeal, and what must be shown?',
		'Can a later general law repeal an earlier special law?',
		'What are the effects of repeal on rights, contracts, pending cases, taxes and penal liability?',
		'What happens when a repealing law is itself repealed or declared void?'
	],
	keyPoints: [
		'Amendments and repeals by implication are neither presumed nor favored.',
		'An amended statute is read with the original; the amendment is treated as if it had always been there; omitted parts of the amended section are repealed; amendments are prospective.',
		'Omitted provisions of a revised code are deemed repealed only if the code was meant to cover the whole subject and replace the old law (<i>Mecano</i>).',
		'An express repeal names the law repealed; "all inconsistent laws are repealed" is not an express repeal (<i>Mecano</i>; <i>Magtajas</i>).',
		'Implied repeal: (1) irreconcilable conflict, or (2) the later law covers the whole subject as a substitute. Same subject, irreconcilable, cannot both be given effect, same object.',
		'Repeal is prospective: vested rights survive; taxes already assessed remain collectible; total repeal of a penal law ends pending prosecutions unless the offense is reenacted or there is a saving clause.'
	],
	connects: `Chapter X completes Chapter VI (harmonization, general and special laws) and applies Chapter IX (prospectivity, vested rights, favorable penal laws) to amendments and repeals. Art. 7 of the Civil Code supplies the codal base. <i>Magtajas</i> (general repealing clause; implied repeal disfavored) and <i>Corona</i> (partial implied repeal by a later special law) are the case links.`,
	objectives: [
		'Explain how amendments are made and read, and their temporal effect.',
		'Apply the rule on omitted provisions in a revision, including the <i>Mecano</i> limit.',
		'Distinguish express from implied repeal and explain why a general repealing clause is not an express repeal.',
		'State the two kinds of implied repeal and the requisites of implied repeal by irreconcilable inconsistency.',
		'Enumerate the effects of repeal, especially of penal and tax laws.',
		'State the rules on repeal or annulment of a repealing law.',
		'Explain how <i>Magtajas</i> and <i>Corona</i> treated repeal.'

	concepts: [
		{
			term: 'Amendment',
			plain: 'A change in the wording of an existing law.',
			legal: 'An alteration of an existing statute, usually done expressly: the amendatory act names the sections amended and reproduces them, commonly "to read as follows." Amendment by implication is neither presumed nor favored (§§10.01–10.04).',
			why: 'Express amendment gives clear notice of what changed.',
			example: 'An act amending a law\'s effectivity period from two years to four.',
			confuse: 'Repeal, which ends a law or provision rather than changing its terms.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Revision and codification',
			plain: 'Rewriting a whole body of law on a subject into one statute.',
			legal: 'The legislature restates existing laws on a subject into a single statute, simplifying, adding, omitting, rephrasing or rearranging provisions. Provisions omitted are deemed repealed, unless the code provides otherwise, but only when the revision was meant to cover the whole subject and substitute for the old law (§§10.11–10.15; <i>Mecano v. COA</i>).',
			why: 'A code is meant to be a complete and coherent system on its subject.',
			example: 'The Agricultural Land Reform Code revised the Agricultural Tenancy Act, impliedly repealing the parts it replaced.',
			confuse: 'A partial code. If the new code covers only part of the subject, omissions are not repeals.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Express repeal',
			plain: 'The new law names the law it cancels.',
			legal: 'A declaration in a statute, usually in its repealing clause, that a particular and specific law, identified by number or title, is repealed. All other repeals are implied (§10.17).',
			why: 'It removes doubt about legislative intent.',
			example: 'R.A. 7636 (1992) repealed R.A. 1700, the Anti-Subversion Act.',
			confuse: 'A general repealing clause ("all laws inconsistent herewith are repealed"), which does not identify the law and is not an express repeal.'
		},
		{
			term: 'General repealing clause',
			plain: 'The catch-all "inconsistent laws are repealed" sentence at the end of many statutes.',
			legal: 'A clause repealing "all laws or parts thereof inconsistent with this Act." It is not an express repeal; it merely expresses the intent to repeal what is irreconcilable, so any repeal under it must still be shown to be implied (<i>Mecano</i>; <i>Magtajas</i>).',
			why: 'Without naming a law, the clause does not show which law the legislature meant to end.',
			example: 'LGC Sec. 534(f) did not repeal P.D. 1869, which was not among the laws specifically listed in Sec. 534(a)–(e) (<i>Magtajas</i>).',
			confuse: 'An express repeal.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Implied repeal',
			plain: 'A repeal that is not stated but follows because two laws cannot both stand.',
			legal: 'Two categories: (1) where provisions of two acts on the same subject are irreconcilable, the later act, to the extent of the conflict, repeals the earlier; (2) where the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier and is clearly intended as a substitute (<i>Mecano</i>; §10.19). <i>Leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant</i>.',
			why: 'The later law is the latest expression of the legislative will.',
			example: 'A later law fixing a different penalty for exactly the same act, with no way to apply both.',
			confuse: 'Different wording or overlapping subject matter, neither of which alone is repeal.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Saving clause',
			plain: 'A clause keeping pending cases or existing rights alive after a repeal.',
			legal: 'A provision in the repealing law preserving rights, liabilities or pending proceedings under the repealed law. With it, a total repeal of a penal law does not end pending prosecutions (§10.38).',
			why: 'To prevent the repeal from giving amnesty-like effect to pending cases.',
			example: '"Cases pending at the effectivity of this Act shall continue to be governed by the repealed law."',
			confuse: 'A reenactment, which keeps the offense alive by restating it.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Repeal and reenactment',
			plain: 'Ending a law and putting the same rule back at the same time.',
			legal: 'Where a statute is repealed and its provisions are simultaneously reenacted, rights and liabilities that accrued are not affected and pending prosecutions continue, because the reenactment neutralizes the repeal. If continuity is broken, the repeal deprives the court of authority to try and sentence under the old law (§10.37).',
			why: 'There was never a moment when the act ceased to be an offense.',
			example: 'A new code repeals the old penal law but restates the same offense with a lighter penalty: pending cases continue, with the lighter penalty applied.',
			confuse: 'A total repeal without reenactment, which ends pending prosecutions.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Repeal vs. expiration',
			plain: 'A law can end because it is repealed or because its time runs out.',
			legal: 'Expiration of a temporary law during pending proceedings does not divest the tribunal of jurisdiction or make an illegal act legal (§10.39).',
			why: 'A temporary law was always meant to govern acts during its life.',
			example: 'Expiration of a law declaring certain imports illegal did not stop a forfeiture case already begun.',
			confuse: 'Total repeal of a penal law, which does end pending prosecutions (absent reenactment or a saving clause).'
		},
		{
			term: 'Revival of a repealed law',
			plain: 'Does an old law come back if the law that repealed it is itself repealed?',
			legal: 'If the repealing law is declared unconstitutional, it never took effect, so the earlier law was never repealed. If a law that <b>expressly</b> repealed an earlier law is itself repealed, the earlier law is not revived unless expressly provided. If the repeal was <b>implied</b>, the earlier law is generally revived when the repealing law is repealed, unless otherwise provided (§§10.40–10.41).',
			why: 'An express repeal shows a deliberate decision to end the first law; an implied repeal existed only because of the conflict.',
			example: 'Act B expressly repealed Act A; Act C repeals Act B without mentioning A: Act A stays dead.',
			confuse: 'Reenactment, where the legislature deliberately restates the old rule.'

	principles: [
		{
			name: 'Amendments: how made, how read, and their effect',
			rule: 'Amendments are usually express ("to read as follows"); amendment by implication is not favored. The statute and its amendment are read together as a whole; the amended act is treated as if the original had been repealed and a new law in the amended form adopted, so the amendment becomes part of the original as if it had always been there. Unchanged parts keep the same meaning; parts of the amended section omitted in the amendment are deemed repealed; retained portions are a continuation of the old law. A change in language suggests a change in meaning.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§10.01–10.06.',
			why: 'To fit the amendment into the original scheme without disturbing what was not changed.',
			when: 'Any question about the reach or meaning of an amended provision.',
			limits: 'Amendments operate prospectively and do not impair vested rights (§10.07). Statutes altering a court\'s jurisdiction do not apply to pending cases unless they so provide (§10.08). If the amendatory act is declared unconstitutional, the original remains in force (§10.10). An amendatory act complete in itself is treated as an independent act.',
			differs: 'A repeal ends the law or provision; an amendment changes it but keeps the law\'s identity.',
			example: 'A law to be effective for two years from approval is amended to four years: the four years run from the original approval, not from the amendment (§10.05).'
		},
		{
			name: 'Revision and codification: omitted provisions are deemed repealed — if the code replaces the whole subject',
			rule: 'In a revision or codification, provisions are harmonized as one statute from a consistent philosophy. Provisions of the old law omitted from the revision are deemed repealed, unless the code provides otherwise. Rearrangement or a change of phraseology does not change the law unless the intent to change is clear; restated provisions are a continuation.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§10.11–10.15; <i>Mecano v. COA</i>, 216 SCRA 500 (1992).',
			why: 'A revision is meant to be a complete and perfect system on its subject.',
			when: 'A new code or revised law omits a provision of the old law.',
			limits: '<b>Only if the revision was clearly intended to cover the whole subject and substitute for the old law.</b> In <i>Mecano</i>, the 1987 Administrative Code covered only administration, organization and procedure, not everything in the 1917 Code, so its omission of Sec. 699 (reimbursement of medical expenses) was not a repeal.',
			differs: 'Implied repeal by substitution (Ch. X, Part C) uses the same "whole subject" test.',
			example: 'Sec. 18 of the old Rule 41 was not reproduced in the 1997 Rules and was held repealed, because the 1997 Rules revised the same subject (per your earlier guide).'
		},
		{
			name: 'Repeal: express or implied; a general repealing clause is not express; disuse never repeals',
			rule: 'Repeal may be total or partial, express or implied. An express repeal identifies the specific law repealed; all others are implied. A general repealing clause is not an express repeal. Laws are repealed only by subsequent ones; their violation is not excused by disuse, custom or contrary practice.',
			basis: 'Art. 7, Civil Code; Agpalo §§10.16–10.18; <i>Mecano v. COA</i>; <i>Magtajas v. Pryce</i>.',
			why: 'Only the legislature can end a law, and it must do so clearly enough to be known.',
			when: 'A party claims a law is no longer in force.',
			limits: 'The legislature\'s power to repeal is plenary, subject only to constitutional limits; there are no irrepealable laws. But a change in conditions or the mere fact that a later law deals with the same subject is not a repeal.',
			differs: 'Repeal must come from a statute; courts may declare a law void for unconstitutionality, but that is not a repeal (Art. 7, par. 2).',
			example: '<i>Magtajas</i>: Sec. 534(a)–(e) listed specific laws repealed; P.D. 1869 was not among them, and Sec. 534(f) (general clause) could support only an implied repeal, which was not shown.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Implied repeal: two categories, strict requisites, and a presumption against it',
			rule: 'Implied repeal occurs (1) where two acts on the same subject are irreconcilable, the later repealing the earlier to the extent of the conflict, or (2) where the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier and is clearly intended as a substitute. For the first: same subject matter; clear inconsistency such that they cannot be harmonized; both cannot be given effect; and the same object or purpose. The inconsistency must be clear and convincing.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§10.19–10.22; <i>Mecano v. COA</i>; <i>Magtajas</i>; <i>Ty v. Trampe</i>, 250 SCRA 500 (1995); <i>Hagad v. Gozo-Dadole</i>, 251 SCRA 242 (1995).',
			why: 'The legislature is presumed to know existing laws and not to enact conflicting ones; doubts are resolved in favor of harmonizing.',
			when: 'A later law appears to clash with an earlier one and neither names the other.',
			limits: 'Different wording alone is not repugnance. If the laws have different objects, both stand even on the same subject. Courts must try to harmonize first (Ch. VI).',
			differs: 'Express repeal needs no showing of conflict; implied repeal needs a clear one.',
			example: '<i>Hagad</i>: the LGC and the Ombudsman Act both give disciplinary authority over elective local officials; neither repeals the other, and they operate concurrently.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Other instances of implied repeal',
			rule: 'Besides irreconcilable conflict and substitution, implied repeal also results where the later act nullifies the reason or purpose of the earlier act; where the later law is in negative terms (prohibiting a thing, or requiring it be done in a certain manner and not otherwise); where the express repeal of a provision from which an official derives authority implies repeal of the provision he enforces; and where a revision, codification or reenactment covers the whole subject.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§10.19–10.22, as summarized in your earlier guide.',
			why: 'In each case the earlier law has lost its function or been displaced.',
			when: 'A later law, without contradicting the earlier one word for word, removes its reason or its machinery.',
			limits: 'Still subject to the presumption against implied repeal; the effect must be clear.',
			differs: 'These are particular forms of the two Mecano categories, not separate theories.',
			example: 'If the law creating an office is expressly repealed, provisions empowering that office to collect a fee are impliedly repealed.'
		},
		{
			name: 'General and special laws in repeal',
			rule: 'A later general law does not repeal an earlier special law on the same subject unless the legislature clearly intended it or an irreconcilable conflict compels it. A later special law inconsistent with a prior general law repeals it only to the extent of the inconsistency, or is grafted onto it as an exception.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§6.20–6.22 and Ch. X; <i>Magtajas</i> (citing <i>Lichauco & Co. v. Apostol</i>); <i>Corona v. CA</i> (citing <i>NAPOCOR v. Presiding Judge</i>; <i>Lagman v. City of Manila</i>).',
			why: 'The special–general relation itself shows the two were meant to coexist.',
			when: 'One of two conflicting laws is special.',
			limits: 'Clear legislative intent can make the later general law repeal the special law (§6.22).',
			differs: 'A partial repeal (Corona) leaves the general law operating outside the special field.',
			example: '<i>Corona</i>: the PPA Charter partially repealed, or carved an exception out of, Sec. 37(b) of the Civil Service Law, but only at the original stage; the Secretary kept appellate jurisdiction.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Effects of repeal on rights, actions, contracts and taxes',
			rule: 'A repeal makes the statute inoperative from the date the repealing act takes effect. It is not a declaration that the old law was invalid from the start; acts done under it remain valid, and the repeal does not undo consequences while the law was in force. Vested rights survive. Contracts made on the basis of the law then in force are not changed. Taxes assessed before the repeal of a tax law remain collectible unless the repealing law provides otherwise. As a rule, repeal defeats pending actions founded on the repealed statute, except as to vested rights or where there is a saving clause. Jurisdiction acquired over a pending case is not lost by repeal or expiration of the law under which it was acquired.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§10.30–10.36.',
			why: 'Repeal is prospective (Ch. IX), and the Constitution protects vested rights and contracts.',
			when: 'A dispute arises over acts, rights or cases connected with a law that has since been repealed.',
			limits: 'Rights not yet vested may be defeated by repeal.',
			differs: 'Repeal of a penal law has a special rule (next principle).',
			example: 'A tax law is repealed in 2026; a deficiency assessment issued in 2025 can still be collected.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Repeal of penal laws',
			rule: 'A total and absolute repeal of a penal law deprives the courts of authority to punish persons charged under it: the act is no longer a crime, and pending cases must be dismissed. Exceptions: (a) the repealing act reenacts the offense and penalizes the same act, so pending cases continue (and the penalty more favorable to the accused applies); or (b) the repealing act has a saving clause providing that pending actions continue.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§10.37–10.38; R.A. 7636 (1992), repealing R.A. 1700.',
			why: 'Once the State no longer considers the act criminal, punishing it serves no purpose; this matches the favorable-retroactivity rule of Art. 22, RPC.',
			when: 'A penal law is repealed while prosecutions or appeals under it are pending.',
			limits: 'If the repeal and reenactment are not simultaneous and continuity is broken, the repeal deprives the court of authority to try, convict and sentence under the old law (§10.37). A temporary penal law\'s expiration, unlike a repeal, does not end pending cases (§10.39).',
			differs: 'Repeal of a tax law: assessed taxes remain collectible.',

It does not reproduce Sec. 40, and ends: "All laws, decrees and orders inconsistent with this Code are repealed or modified accordingly."
