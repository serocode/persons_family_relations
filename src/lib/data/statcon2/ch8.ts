	title: 'Mandatory and Directory Statutes',
	short: 'Ch. VIII — Mandatory & Directory Statutes',
	sections: '§§8.01–8.23 (section numbers as used in your earlier guide)',

	plain: `Some legal requirements must be followed exactly, or what was done is void: these are <b>mandatory</b>. Others are guidance: breaking them is an irregularity that may get an official disciplined, but the act still stands. These are <b>directory</b>. "Shall" and "may" are clues, not answers. The real test is what the legislature intended, judged mostly by the consequences of each reading.`,
	overview: `<p><b>Part A (§§8.01–8.09)</b> defines the two kinds of statutes, gives the test (legislative intent, read through the consequences of each reading), and explains how much weight words like "shall," "may" and "shall not" carry. <b>Part B (§§8.10–8.19)</b> lists requirements the courts treat as mandatory. <b>Part C (§§8.20–8.23)</b> lists those treated as directory.</p>
<p>Three patterns solve most exam questions. (1) <b>Who must comply?</b> A deadline binding a <i>litigant</i> (to appeal, to pay docket fees) is mandatory; a deadline binding a <i>judge or official</i> (to decide) is usually directory. (2) <b>Whose rights depend on it?</b> Requirements protecting citizens or third persons, or conferring jurisdiction, are mandatory; requirements of order and convenience are directory. (3) <b>When is it raised?</b> Election rules on conduct are mandatory before the election and generally directory after it.</p>`,
	questions: [
		'What makes a statutory requirement mandatory or directory?',
		'What happens when each kind is violated?',
		'Does "shall" always mean mandatory, and "may" always permissive?',
		'Which kinds of requirements are treated as mandatory, and which as directory?',
		'Why is a deadline mandatory for a litigant but directory for a judge?',
		'How do election laws change character before and after an election?'
	],
	keyPoints: [
		'Mandatory → non-compliance makes the act void or brings a sanction. Directory → the act stands; at most an irregularity or administrative liability.',
		'No universal rule: look at the whole statute, its purpose, and the consequences of each reading (§§8.03–8.04).',
		'"Shall" is presumed mandatory and "may" permissive; negative words ("shall not," "only") are mandatory. Each presumption can flip.',
		'Mandatory: jurisdictional requirements, time for litigants to act or appeal, conditions for benefits, qualifications for office, protections in tax assessment and auction sales, election rules before the election.',
		'Directory: guidance for officers, manner of judicial action, time for officials or courts to decide (unless time is of the essence, negative words, or a limit on power).',
		'Art. 5, Civil Code: acts against mandatory or prohibitory laws are void unless the law itself authorizes their validity.'
	],
	connects: `Chapter VIII applies Chapter VII's thinking to commands rather than coverage: requirements that protect rights tend to be mandatory, just as statutes in derogation of rights are strictly construed. It ties to Chapter IX (procedural rules apply to pending cases) and Chapter XI (constitutional provisions are presumed mandatory). <i>Aquino v. Quezon City</i> is the best case illustration: the notice of delinquency is mandatory, but the Court did not demand actual receipt.`,
	objectives: [
		'Define mandatory and directory statutes and state the effect of violating each.',
		'Apply the consequences test and the "effect" test to a new provision.',
		'Explain when "shall" means "may" and when "may" means "shall."',
		'Enumerate the requirements held mandatory and those held directory.',
		'Distinguish deadlines for litigants from deadlines for courts, citing Art. VIII, Sec. 15.',
		'Apply the before/after rule for election laws and its exceptions.',
		'Explain how <i>Aquino</i> treated the notice requirements in a tax sale.'

			term: 'Mandatory statute',
			plain: 'A rule you must follow exactly, or what you did is void.',
			legal: 'A statute whose command must be obeyed on pain of sanction or of the nullity of what is done in disregard of it; the court cannot treat the breach as immaterial (§8.01).',
			why: 'Some requirements are the very thing that protects rights or confers authority.',
			example: 'Paying the appellate docket fees within the period to appeal (<i>Enriquez v. Enriquez</i>).',
			confuse: '"Strictly construed." Strict construction concerns how far a statute reaches; mandatory character concerns what happens if a requirement is not met.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Directory statute',
			plain: 'A rule that guides how something should be done; skipping it does not cancel what was done.',
			legal: 'A statute that is permissive or discretionary, or that merely outlines the act to be done in such a way that no injury can result from ignoring it, or whose purpose can be achieved another way with substantially the same result. Non-compliance may be an irregularity or ground for discipline, but does not invalidate the proceedings (§8.01).',
			why: 'Voiding acts for minor procedural lapses would punish innocent parties for an official\'s mistake.',
			example: 'A judge who decides after the period fixed for decision: the decision is valid.',
			confuse: '"Optional." A directory requirement is still meant to be obeyed; it is only that disobedience does not void the act.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Consequences test',
			plain: 'Ask what would happen under each reading, and pick the one the legislature must have intended.',
			legal: 'There is no universal rule; whether a statute is mandatory or directory depends on legislative intent, found from the whole statute, its nature, object and purpose, and the consequences of construing it one way or the other (§§8.03–8.04).',
			why: 'The words alone ("shall," "may") are not reliable enough to decide whether an act should be void.',
			example: 'If voiding the act would hurt innocent third parties for an official\'s slip, the requirement is likely directory.',
			confuse: 'A word test. Words are only evidence of intent.'
		},
		{
			term: '"Shall" — a word of command',
			plain: '"Shall" usually means "must."',
			legal: '"Shall," "must," "ought" and "should" are presumed mandatory, especially when addressed to public officials or when public interest or private rights are involved (§§8.05–8.06). "Shall" may be read as "may" when the context or intent requires it, or when no public benefit or private right requires it to be imperative.',
			why: 'Words of command ordinarily signal a duty.',
			example: '<i>Director of Lands v. CA</i>: the Commissioner "shall cause" notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation; mandatory.',
			confuse: 'Automatic mandatory character. The test is still intent and consequences (§8.08).'
		},
		{
			term: '"May" — a word of permission',
			plain: '"May" usually means "can, but need not."',
			legal: '"May" is presumed permissive and directory. It is read as "shall" when the law requires an act by justice or public duty, or gives a public officer a power concerning the public interest or individual rights (§§8.07–8.08, 8.10).',
			why: 'A power given for the benefit of others is a duty to those others.',
			example: '"The treasurer may issue a certificate of payment to the taxpayer": because the taxpayer\'s right depends on it, the treasurer must issue it.',
			confuse: 'Pure discretion. Some "mays" impose duties.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Negative (prohibitory) statute',
			plain: '"Shall not" leaves only one way to obey: don\'t.',
			legal: 'Negative, prohibitory and exclusive words ("shall not," "cannot," "ought not," "only") are mandatory; an affirmative statement qualified by "only" is a negative statute. Prohibitions "can rarely, if ever, be directory" (§8.09).',
			why: 'There is no alternative way of complying with a prohibition.',
			example: '"The appeal shall be filed only with the Regional Trial Court": filing elsewhere is ineffective.',
			confuse: 'Penal statutes. A prohibitory statute need not carry a criminal penalty; its violation may simply void the act (Art. 5, Civil Code).'
		},
		{
			term: 'Jurisdictional requirement',
			plain: 'A step without which the court or tribunal has no power to act.',
			legal: 'Requirements by which a court or tribunal acquires jurisdiction must be strictly complied with; non-compliance means no jurisdiction, and the decision is void (§8.12).',
			why: 'Jurisdiction is conferred by law and cannot be created by waiver or convenience.',
			example: 'Publication in land registration, reconstitution of title and naturalization; a written claim for refund before suing for a tax refund.',
			confuse: 'Procedural details of order and method, which are directory (§8.14).'
		},
		{
			term: 'Directory as to time',
			plain: 'An official who misses a deadline still has the power to act.',
			legal: 'Where a statute fixes the time within which a public officer or body must act, it is generally directory as to time: an act done late is not void, though the officer may be dealt with administratively. Exceptions: time is of the essence, the statute uses negative words, or the time was meant as a limit on the power itself (§8.22; <i>PAFLU v. Secretary of Labor</i>).',
			why: 'Voiding late official acts would punish the parties, who are not at fault.',
			example: '<i>Querubin v. CA</i> (1948): the three-month period for deciding election appeals is directory.',
			confuse: 'Time to appeal, which binds litigants and is mandatory.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Art. 5, Civil Code',
			plain: 'Acts that break mandatory or prohibitory laws are void, unless the law says otherwise.',
			legal: '"Acts executed against the provisions of mandatory or prohibitory laws shall be void, except when the law itself authorizes their validity."',
			why: 'It states the general consequence of violating a mandatory or prohibitory law.',
			example: 'A sale of property prohibited by law is void.',
			confuse: 'Directory provisions, whose violation does not void the act.'

	principles: [
		{
			name: 'Mandatory vs. directory: definitions and effects',
			rule: 'A mandatory provision must be obeyed on pain of nullity or sanction. A directory provision merely guides; non-compliance is an irregularity that may expose the official to discipline but does not invalidate the act. Acts against mandatory or prohibitory laws are void unless the law itself authorizes their validity.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §8.01; Art. 5, Civil Code.',
			why: 'The classification decides whether a lapse undoes what was done.',
			when: 'Whenever someone attacks an act or proceeding because a statutory step was skipped.',
			limits: 'Art. 5\'s own exception: the law may authorize the validity of the act despite the violation.',
			differs: 'Mandatory/directory is about the effect of non-compliance; strict/liberal (Ch. VII) is about how far the statute reaches.',
			example: 'Docket fees not paid within the appeal period: the appeal is not perfected (mandatory). Decision released after the period to decide: valid (directory as to time).'
		},
		{
			name: 'The test is legislative intent, read through consequences',
			rule: 'There is no universal rule. Look at the whole statute, its nature, object and purpose, and the consequences of each reading. A requirement is generally directory if no substantial rights depend on it, no injury can result from ignoring it, and its purpose can be achieved another way with substantially the same result; otherwise it is mandatory. Requirements meant to protect citizens are mandatory.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§8.02–8.04.',
			why: 'Words alone cannot tell whether the legislature wanted an act voided for a lapse.',
			when: 'Every classification problem.',
			limits: 'A statute is not construed as mandatory if that would cause hardship or injustice to the innocent public (for instance, through an officer\'s delay) or lead to absurd, impossible or mischievous results; it is read as directory without preventing sanctions on the officer. But mandatory words should not lightly be read as directory, and never so as to make a new law.',
			differs: 'The word test (shall/may) is only evidence within this larger inquiry.',
			example: 'An election officer forgets to detach a ballot coupon. The voter\'s ballot is not voided, because the duty was the officer\'s and the result is not affected.'
		},
		{
			name: 'The words used: "shall," "may," and negative words',
			rule: '"Shall," "must," "ought" and "should" are presumed mandatory; "may" is presumed permissive; negative, prohibitory and exclusive words are mandatory. "Shall" and "may" are interchangeable when the legislature\'s intent, the context and the consequences require.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§8.05–8.09.',
			why: 'Words are the best first evidence of intent, but not conclusive.',
			when: 'Reading the operative verb of a provision.',
			limits: '"Shall" → "may" when context or intent requires, or when no public benefit or private right needs it to be imperative. "May" → "shall" when justice or public duty requires the act, or when a public officer is given a power concerning public interest or private rights. Prohibitions can rarely, if ever, be directory.',
			differs: 'Under the consequences test, the decisive question is: would non-compliance make the act void?',
			example: 'Corporation Code: shares "may be transferred by delivery of the certificate": permissive, so other valid modes exist. <i>Magtajas</i>: Sec. 458 says the sanggunian "shall" enact ordinances against prohibited gambling, so reading "gambling" to include legal gambling would <i>compel</i> every LGU to ban it.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Statutes conferring power and granting benefits are mandatory',
			rule: 'A statute giving a public body or officer power to act on matters of public interest or private rights is mandatory even if worded permissively: it imposes rather than confers. Steps or conditions required to avail of a statutory benefit are mandatory, and failure to take them usually means loss of the benefit.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§8.10–8.11.',
			why: 'The power is given for others\' benefit, and benefits are conditioned on the steps the law sets. <i>Qui prior est in tempore, potior est in jure</i>.',
			when: 'An officer refuses to act under a "may" provision affecting others; a claimant skipped a condition for a benefit.',
			limits: 'Where the statute clearly leaves the matter to the officer\'s discretion and no right depends on it, "may" stays permissive.',
			differs: 'Compare Ch. VII §7.15: conditions of privileges are also strictly complied with.',
			example: 'A tax amnesty requires filing within 90 days; a taxpayer who files on day 100 loses the benefit.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Jurisdictional and protective procedural requirements, and time for litigants, are mandatory',
			rule: 'Requirements by which a court acquires jurisdiction must be strictly complied with. Periods for litigants to act or appeal are mandatory. Procedural acts that are jurisdictional, of the essence of the proceeding, or prescribed for the protection of the parties are mandatory; mere details of order and method are directory.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§8.12–8.14; <i>Director of Lands v. CA</i>, G.R. No. 102858, July 28, 1997; <i>Enriquez v. Enriquez</i>, G.R. No. 139303, Aug. 25, 2005; Rule 41, Sec. 4.',
			why: 'Jurisdiction and due process cannot depend on convenience; deadlines for litigants prevent delay and give finality.',
			when: 'Publication, notice, filing periods, docket fees.',
			limits: 'Liberal construction of the Rules of Court (Ch. VII) does not excuse a mandatory and jurisdictional requirement, except in rare cases the Court itself recognizes for compelling reasons.',
			differs: 'Deadlines for <i>officials or courts</i> to act are generally directory (§8.22).',
			example: '<i>Director of Lands v. CA</i>: publication of the notice of initial hearing in a newspaper of general circulation is mandatory, even though P.D. 1529 says Official Gazette publication suffices to confer jurisdiction, because due process requires notice people actually read.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Election laws: before vs. after the election; qualifications always mandatory',
			rule: 'Provisions on the conduct of elections are mandatory if enforced before the election in a direct proceeding, but generally directory after the election, so that innocent voters are not disenfranchised. Provisions on qualifications and disqualifications of candidates, and qualifications for public office, are mandatory; eligibility is continuing.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§8.15–8.17.',
			why: 'Before the election, compliance can still be compelled; after it, voiding ballots punishes voters for officials\' lapses. Eligibility goes to the right to hold office itself.',
			when: 'A pre-election action to compel compliance; a post-election protest attacking ballots; a disqualification case.',
			limits: 'Even after the election, a provision stays mandatory if (1) violation obstructs the free and intelligent casting of votes or the ascertainment of the result, (2) it affects an essential element of the election, or (3) the statute expressly declares the act essential or its omission fatal.',
			differs: 'Qualification rules are mandatory before and after the election; conduct rules change character.',
			example: 'Votes for a candidate later found ineligible are void, and he is ousted. But a voter\'s ballot is not voided because the election officer forgot to detach its coupon.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Tax assessment and public auction sales',
			rule: 'In assessing taxes, provisions that protect taxpayers, secure equality, or give certainty are mandatory; those merely for the information or direction of officers are directory. Notice of assessment within the period is mandatory. The procedure for public auction sales is mandatory and must be strictly followed; otherwise the sale is void.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§8.18–8.19; <i>Aquino v. Quezon City</i> (2006).',
			why: 'These laws take property, so the protections built into them are part of due process.',
			when: 'A tax-delinquency sale or an assessment is attacked for want of notice or other steps.',
			limits: '<i>Aquino</i>: the notice of delinquency is mandatory, but where notice is sent directly to the owner, posting and publication are not indispensable (a tax sale is <i>in personam</i>), and Sec. 73 requires that the notice of sale be <i>sent</i>, not received.',
			differs: 'The mandatory character attaches to the protection, not to every detail of how it is delivered.',
			example: 'A treasurer who auctions land without any notice of delinquency to the owner produces a void sale.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Directory requirements: guidance for officers, manner of judicial action, time to decide',
			rule: 'Requirements meant to guide officers for order, system and dispatch are directory, unless accompanied by negative words. Requirements on the manner in which judges act are generally directory. A period within which a court or officer must decide is directory as to time: a late decision is valid, though the officer may answer administratively.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§8.20–8.23; <i>Querubin v. CA</i>, G.R. No. L-2581, Dec. 2, 1948; <i>PAFLU v. Secretary of Labor</i>, 27 SCRA 40 (1969); Art. VIII, Sec. 15(4), 1987 Constitution.',
			why: 'Procedure is secondary to substantive rights, and the parties should not lose their case because the official was slow.',
			when: 'A decision or official act is attacked as late or irregular in form.',
			limits: 'Time is mandatory when it is of the essence, when the statute uses negative words, or when it limits the officer\'s power (e.g., "shall be deemed approved"). The Constitution calls the periods in Art. VIII, Sec. 15 "mandatory," but Sec. 15(4) itself says the court shall still decide after the period expires, without prejudice to the judge\'s liability.',
			differs: 'Deadlines for litigants (to appeal, to pay fees) are mandatory.',
			example: 'A trial judge decides on day 100 of a 90-day period: the decision stands; the judge may be sanctioned.'
