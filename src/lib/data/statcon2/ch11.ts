	short: 'Ch. XI — Constitutional Construction',
	sections: '§§11.01–11.19 (section numbers as used in your earlier guide)',

	plain: `The Constitution is the highest law, so everything else must fit it. To read it, start with the <b>words</b> in their ordinary meaning. If the words are unclear, look to the <b>reason</b>: what the framers intended and why. And read the <b>whole</b> document together. Its provisions are presumed <b>mandatory</b> and <b>self-executing</b>, so they work even without a law implementing them.`,
	overview: `<p>Chapter XI applies the tools of statutory construction to the fundamental law, with adjustments. The Constitution is written by the sovereign people, meant to last, and addressed to every branch of government. So its words are read in their ordinary sense (it is "not primarily a lawyer\'s document"), its purpose is to realize the intent of the framers <i>and the people who ratified it</i>, and its provisions are presumed mandatory and self-executing, the reverse of the cautious presumptions for some statutes.</p>
<p>Learn the <b>three maxims in order</b> (<i>Francisco v. House</i>): <b>verba legis</b> → <b>ratio legis est anima</b> → <b>ut magis valeat quam pereat</b>. Words first; if ambiguous, the reason; and always the whole.</p>`,
	questions: [
		'What is a constitution, and what is the primary purpose of constitutional construction?',
		'How is constitutional language read?',
		'What aids may be used when the language is unclear, and how much weight do convention debates carry?',
		'Why must the Constitution be read as a whole?',
		'Are constitutional provisions mandatory? Are they self-executing?',
		'What are the three maxims of constitutional construction, and in what order are they applied?'
	],
	keyPoints: [
		'Purpose: ascertain the intent of the framers and the people as expressed in the text, and assure its realization.',
		'Verba legis first: ordinary meaning (technical terms excepted), used broadly; plain text is applied as written (<i>J.M. Tuason</i>).',
		'If ambiguous: ratio legis est anima, using history, the evils to be remedied, convention debates (persuasive, not controlling), prior laws and rulings, changes in wording, and consequences.',
		'Read as a whole: no provision is considered alone; a specific provision qualifies a general one (<i>Civil Liberties Union</i>).',
		'Presumed mandatory, and presumed self-executing (<i>Manila Prince Hotel</i>); Congress may still legislate to enforce.',
		'A provision that is clearly a policy guideline or leaves the matter "as may be provided by law" is not self-executing.'
	],
	connects: `Chapter XI is Chapters III–VI applied to the Constitution: verba legis (Ch. IV), extrinsic aids (Ch. III), construction as a whole (Ch. VI). It also bounds every other chapter, since every statute must be read in harmony with the Constitution (§6.14). It connects to Chapter VIII on the constitutional periods to decide, and to <i>Magtajas</i> on local autonomy and the limits of local power.`,
	objectives: [
		'Define a constitution and state the primary purpose of constitutional construction.',
		'Apply the three maxims in order to an unfamiliar provision.',
		'Enumerate the aids to constitutional construction and state the weight of convention debates.',
		'Explain the presumptions that constitutional provisions are mandatory and self-executing.',
		'Distinguish self-executing from non-self-executing provisions using textual indicators.',
		'Explain <i>Manila Prince Hotel</i>, <i>Civil Liberties Union</i>, <i>Francisco</i>, <i>Nitafan</i> and <i>J.M. Tuason</i>.',
		'Explain why local autonomy did not save the ordinances in <i>Magtajas</i>.'

The people in ratifying are presumed guided mainly by the framers\' explanation (§§11.02–11.03; <i>Nitafan v. CIR</i>).',
			why: 'The Constitution\'s authority comes from the people\'s ratification.',

		{
			term: 'A living (enduring) Constitution',
			plain: 'The Constitution is written in broad words so it can handle new situations.',
			legal: 'Constitutional provisions are "not mathematical formulas" but "organic living institutions"; the Constitution is a continuously operative charter of government, read in a way consistent with reason, justice and the public interest, and not as demanding the impossible, impractical or absurd (§11.04).',
			why: 'A constitution is meant to last for generations.',
			example: 'Broad terms such as "due process" apply to technologies the framers never imagined.',
			confuse: 'Judicial amendment. A living reading still starts from, and cannot contradict, the text.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Verba legis (in constitutional construction)',
			plain: 'Start with what the words say.',
			legal: 'Wherever possible, the words of the Constitution are given their ordinary meaning, except where technical terms are employed; where the language is plain, clear and unambiguous, it is applied as written (§§11.05, 11.18; <i>J.M. Tuason & Co. v. LTA</i>; <i>Francisco</i>).',
			why: 'The Constitution is "not primarily a lawyer\'s document"; the people ratified the words in their ordinary sense.',
			example: '<i>Manila Prince Hotel</i>: "patrimony" in its ordinary meaning refers to heritage, so it covers cultural heritage, not only natural resources.',
			confuse: 'Literalism that defeats the evident purpose. Verba legis is where you begin, not always where you end.'

			term: '<i>Ratio legis est anima</i>',
			plain: 'The reason of the law is its soul.',
			legal: 'Where there is ambiguity, the words are interpreted in accordance with the intent of the framers, as shown by the circumstances, history and debates surrounding the provision (§11.18; <i>Francisco</i>).',
			why: 'When words admit two meanings, the purpose decides.',

			why: 'The framers wrote one coherent document.',
			example: '<i>Civil Liberties Union</i>: Art. IX-B, Sec. 7, par. 2 (general rule for civil servants) was read with Art. VII, Sec. 13 (stricter rule for the President, Vice-President, Cabinet and their deputies).',

			term: 'Self-executing provision',
			plain: 'A provision that works by itself; no law is needed to enforce it in court.',
			legal: 'A provision complete in itself, which supplies a sufficient rule by which the right it grants may be enjoyed or protected, or the duty it imposes enforced, without need of supplementary legislation. Constitutional provisions are presumed self-executing unless the contrary is clearly intended (§11.17; <i>Manila Prince Hotel v. GSIS</i>).',
			why: 'Otherwise Congress could nullify the Constitution simply by not legislating. <i>Ubi jus ibi remedium</i>.',
			example: 'Art. XII, Sec. 10, par. 2 (preference to qualified Filipinos) was enforced without an implementing law in <i>Manila Prince Hotel</i>.',
			confuse: 'A provision Congress cannot legislate on. Congress may still pass laws to enforce, penalize violations, and supply details.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Non-self-executing provision',
			plain: 'A provision that needs a law from Congress before it can be enforced in court.',
			legal: 'A provision that lays down a principle or policy, or expressly leaves implementation to legislation ("as may be provided by law," "Congress shall provide"), and does not itself supply a judicially enforceable rule. The Declaration of Principles and State Policies (Art. II) is generally of this kind, though some provisions have been enforced (e.g., <i>Oposa v. Factoran</i> on the right to a balanced and healthful ecology).',
			why: 'Some provisions are guidelines for legislation, not rules courts can apply directly.',

			confuse: 'A self-executing provision that Congress chooses to implement anyway.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Presumption that constitutional provisions are mandatory',
			plain: 'In the Constitution, "shall" really means "shall."',
			legal: 'Constitutional provisions are presumed mandatory unless, by express provision or necessary implication, a different intention is manifest; they are directory only where that is unmistakably shown. The rules on mandatory and directory statutes are of little use here (§11.14).',
			why: 'In a constitution the sovereign itself speaks and binds all departments; calling provisions directory invites disregard.',
			example: 'The constitutional periods to decide cases are called "mandatory" (Art. VIII, Sec. 15), though Sec. 15(4) itself says late decisions are still to be rendered.',
			confuse: 'Statutes, where directory readings are common.'

			plain: 'The framers\' debates help show what they meant, but they are not the Constitution.',
			legal: 'The debates and proceedings may be consulted to ascertain intent, but they are persuasive, not controlling. They show the views of individual members, and the proper interpretation depends more on how the people who ratified the text understood it (<i>Civil Liberties Union</i>; §11.08).',
			why: 'The people ratified the final text, not the speeches.',

			facts: 'The national government decides to sell, through public bidding, a controlling stake in a corporation that owns a century-old railway station complex declared a national cultural treasure. A foreign consortium submits the highest bid. A qualified Filipino corporation, the only other bidder, offers to match the winning bid and invokes Art. XII, Sec. 10, par. 2 of the Constitution. The government refuses, arguing that no law has yet been passed implementing the Filipino-preference clause.',
			q: 'May the Filipino corporation enforce the preference? Answer using ALAC.',
			alac: {
				answer: 'Yes. It may match the winning bid and enforce the constitutional preference.',
				legalBasis: 'Art. XII, Sec. 10, par. 2: "In the grant of rights, privileges, and concessions covering the national economy and patrimony, the State shall give preference to qualified Filipinos." Constitutional provisions are presumed self-executing unless the contrary is clearly intended; otherwise Congress could nullify them by inaction (Agpalo §11.17). In <i>Manila Prince Hotel v. GSIS</i>, the Court held this provision self-executing and gave "patrimony" its ordinary meaning, including cultural heritage.',
				application: 'The preference clause is a positive command ("shall give preference") that a court can apply without further legislation; nothing in it says "as may be provided by law." The station complex, a national cultural treasure, is part of the national patrimony in the ordinary sense of heritage. The Filipino corporation is qualified and offered to match the highest bid, which is exactly the situation in <i>Manila Prince Hotel</i>. The absence of an implementing law does not defeat a self-executing right.',
				conclusion: 'The government must award the stake to the Filipino corporation upon its matching of the winning bid.'

IX-B, Sec. 7, par. 2 of the Constitution, which allows appointive officials to hold other government offices if allowed by law or by the primary functions of their position, and a statute allowing the President to designate officials to GOCC posts. A taxpayer challenges the appointment.',
			q: 'Is the appointment valid? Answer using ALAC.',
			alac: {
				answer: 'No. The appointment violates Art. VII, Sec. 13.',
				legalBasis: 'The Constitution is construed as a whole; no provision is considered alone, and a specific provision qualifies a general one (Agpalo §11.13). Art. VII, Sec. 13 bars the President, Vice-President, Cabinet members and their deputies or assistants from holding any other office or employment during their tenure, "unless otherwise provided in this Constitution." In <i>Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary</i>, the Court held this a stricter rule that qualifies the general allowance in Art. IX-B, Sec. 7, par. 2, permitting only ex officio positions required by the primary functions of the office, without additional compensation.',
				application: 'An Undersecretary is a deputy of a Cabinet member, so Art. VII, Sec. 13 applies to him. The order relies on Art. IX-B, Sec. 7, par. 2 and on a statute, but read with Art. VII, Sec. 13 that general provision cannot authorize what the specific provision forbids for members of the Executive. The hotel presidency is unrelated to the functions of the Department of Finance and carries a separate salary, so it is not an ex officio post required by his primary functions.',

Constitutional provisions are presumed mandatory (§11.14).',
				application: 'In ordinary usage, "employment" includes any paid work for another, full-time or part-time. A salaried teaching position at a state university is employment in the plain sense, and in government at that. The text uses the broad phrase "any other office or employment" and makes no exception for part-time work, so there is no ambiguity requiring resort to the framers\' intent.

			q: 'Should the court grant Lina\'s petition? Discuss using ALAC.',

A provision is not self-executing where it lays down a policy or expressly leaves its implementation to legislation, as by "as may be provided by law" (<i>Tañada v. Angara</i>; <i>Kilosbayan v.

				application: 'The presumption is overcome by the text itself. The clause directs the State to "establish a system" and expressly leaves its "terms and conditions" to be "provided by law": who qualifies as indigent, which civil cases are covered, and how lawyers are assigned and paid. Without those terms there is no rule a court can apply. <i>Manila Prince Hotel</i> is distinguishable: there, "the State shall give preference to qualified Filipinos" was complete in itself and contained no deferral to legislation.',

				legalBasis: 'Constitutional provisions are presumed mandatory (Agpalo §11.14), but the Constitution is read as a whole, and every part must be given effect (<i>ut magis valeat quam pereat</i>; §11.13; <i>Francisco</i>). Art. VIII, Sec. 15(4) provides: "Despite the expiration of the applicable mandatory period, the court, without prejudice to such responsibility as may have been incurred in consequence thereof, shall decide or resolve the case ... without further delay."',
				application: 'The movant reads Sec. 15(1) alone and imports the statutory idea that "mandatory" always means "void if violated." Read with Sec. 15(4), the Constitution itself prescribes the consequence of missing the period: the court must still decide, and the delay may create responsibility for the justices. The period is mandatory in the sense that it imposes a binding duty, not in the sense that it ends the court\'s jurisdiction.
