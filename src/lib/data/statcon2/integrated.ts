Harmonization comes first, because the legislature is presumed to know existing laws and implied repeals are disfavored. In <i>Magtajas</i>, the LGC and P.D. 1869 were harmonized: LGUs may suppress gambling except gambling authorized by statute. In <i>Corona</i>, the Court described the PPA Charter\'s effect as a partial implied repeal <i>or</i> an exception grafted onto the Civil Service Law, and then harmonized the two into original and appellate stages.',

			{ cat: 'C', level: 2, topic: 'Repealing clause', chapters: 'Chs. VI & X', q: 'Why is a general repealing clause not an express repeal, and how does that relate to the duty to harmonize?', short: 'Because it does not identify any particular law; it only declares that whatever is inconsistent is repealed, leaving open which laws are inconsistent (<i>Mecano</i>; <i>Magtajas</i>).

COMELEC</i>). It reflects constitutional supremacy (Art. 7, par. 2, Civil Code; Ch. XI): the legislature is presumed to have legislated within the Constitution, so the reading consistent with the fundamental law is presumed intended.

Procedural laws apply to pending cases (§9.19), but not where application would be unfeasible or work injustice (§9.20).

In 2024, Congress enacted the (hypothetical) Water Resources Code, a general law providing that "all water-extraction permits shall be issued by the National Water Board," with a final clause: "All laws inconsistent herewith are repealed or modified accordingly." The Code does not mention R.A. No. 13100. In 2026 a farmer obtains a permit from the District Board. The National Water Board declares it void.',
				q: 'Is the District Board\'s permit valid? Answer using ALAC.',

					answer: 'Yes. R.A. No. 13100, a special law, was not repealed by the later general Code and remains an exception to it.',
					legalBasis: 'Where a special and a general law on the same subject conflict, the special law prevails as an exception, whichever is later (<i>generalia specialibus non derogant</i>; Agpalo §§6.20–6.21).

X:</b> Sec. 534(f) is a general repealing clause, not an express repeal; P.D. 1869 is absent from the specific list; implied repeal is disfavored, and later laws treat P.D. 1869 as alive. <b>Ch. XI:</b> local autonomy reduces but does not remove Congress\'s control; the delegate cannot be superior to the principal, and the Constitution does not prohibit gambling. Result: the ordinances are ultra vires and void.', keys: 'harmonization; liberal construction needs doubt; general repealing clause; local autonomy limited' }

				topic: 'Tax exemption & repeal',
				chapters: 'Chs. VI, VII, IX & X',
				title: 'Integrated — The cooperative\'s VAT exemption',
				facts: 'R.A. No. 13200 (hypothetical, 2010), a special law on cooperatives, exempts "sales of goods by duly registered cooperatives to their members" from VAT. On January 1, 2025, a general tax reform law took effect providing: "All exemptions from value-added tax granted under special or general laws are hereby withdrawn, except those enumerated in Section 50 of this Act." Cooperative sales are not in Section 50. The law also contains a general repealing clause. Kooperatiba ng Bayan sold goods to its members in December 2024 and in February 2025. The BIR assesses VAT on both. The cooperative argues that (1) the special law prevails over the later general law; (2) tax laws are construed against the government; and (3) even if the exemption was withdrawn, it cannot reach the December 2024 sales.',
				q: 'Resolve each argument and state which sales are taxable. Answer using ALAC.',
				alac: {
					answer: 'The February 2025 sales are subject to VAT; the December 2024 sales are not.',
					legalBasis: 'A special law generally prevails over a later general law, but not where the legislature clearly intended the later general law to cover the whole subject and repeal inconsistent laws (Agpalo §6.22). Implied repeals are disfavored, but an express, specific withdrawal is not an implied repeal (§§10.17–10.20). Tax impositions are construed against the government, but tax exemptions are construed <i>strictissimi juris</i> against the claimant (§§7.19–7.20). Laws operate prospectively (Art. 4, Civil Code); amendments and repeals do not affect acts completed before their effectivity (§§10.07, 10.30).',
					application: '<b>Argument (1):</b> the tax reform law does more than state a general rule or rely on a general repealing clause. It expressly withdraws "all exemptions ... granted under special or general laws," except an enumerated list that does not include cooperatives. That is the clear intent to cover the whole subject and override special laws that §6.22 requires, so <i>generalia specialibus</i> does not save the exemption. <b>Argument (2):</b> the question is not whether a tax is imposed but whether an exemption survives; exemptions are construed against the claimant, and the cooperative points to no surviving grant. <b>Argument (3):</b> correct. The withdrawal took effect on January 1, 2025 and operates prospectively; the December 2024 sales were completed while the exemption was in force.',
					conclusion: 'VAT is due on the February 2025 sales only; the assessment on the December 2024 sales should be cancelled.'
				},
				weaker: 'The cooperative\'s first two arguments would be strong against a mere general repealing clause (as in <i>Magtajas</i>), but not against an express withdrawal that names "special laws" and lists its own exceptions.'

				title: 'Integrated — The voiding statute',
				facts: 'A (hypothetical) 2026 statute provides: "Any decision of the Court of Appeals rendered beyond twelve months from submission shall be void. This Act shall apply to all decisions, including those already rendered." A party who lost in the CA in 2024, in a decision rendered 14 months after submission and already final, moves to annul it under the statute.',
				q: 'Is the statute valid, and may the 2024 decision be annulled? Discuss using ALAC.',
				alac: {
					answer: 'No. The statute is unconstitutional, and the 2024 decision may not be annulled.',
					legalBasis: 'The Constitution is read as a whole; Art. VIII, Sec. 15(4) provides that despite the expiration of the "mandatory period," the court "shall decide or resolve the case," without prejudice to responsibility (Agpalo §§11.13–11.14). A statute is construed in harmony with the Constitution only if fairly susceptible of a saving reading; a clear statute contrary to the Constitution is void (§6.14; Art. 7, par. 2, Civil Code). Retroactive laws may not divest vested rights, including rights embodied in a final judgment (§§9.05, 9.10).',
					application: 'The statute clearly declares late decisions void, contradicting Sec. 15(4), which commands the court to decide even after the period and preserves the validity of a late decision while leaving the justices accountable. The words leave no room for a saving construction, so the statute is void as inconsistent with the Constitution. Independently, the retroactivity clause would undo a final judgment rendered in 2024, divesting the winning party of a vested right.',
					conclusion: 'The motion to annul should be denied; the statute is void, and the 2024 decision stands.'

				weaker: 'Treating the constitutional periods as jurisdictional ignores Sec. 15(4) and the rule that the Constitution is read as a whole.'

				topic: 'Ordinance v. special charter',
				chapters: 'Chs. VI, VII, X & XI',
				title: 'Integrated — The harbor vendors',
				facts: 'The (hypothetical) Metro Harbor Authority Charter (2000), a special law, gives the Authority "exclusive power to license and regulate vendors within the port zone." In 2026, Bayside City, invoking the general welfare clause (LGC Sec. 16), Sec. 5(a) of the LGC, and local autonomy, enacts an ordinance banning all vendors within the port zone, which lies inside city limits, and orders the Authority\'s licensed vendors removed. The city argues that the LGC is the controlling later law and that its general repealing clause repealed any inconsistent charter provision.',
				q: 'Is the ordinance valid as applied to the port zone? Discuss using ALAC.',
				alac: {
					answer: 'No. As applied to the port zone, the ordinance is ultra vires and void.',
					legalBasis: 'An ordinance must not contravene a statute; LGUs exercise delegated power, and the delegate cannot be superior to the principal; local autonomy does not remove Congress\'s control (<i>Magtajas</i>; Ch. XI). A special law prevails over a general law on the same subject, and a general law (or general repealing clause) does not repeal a special law absent clear intent (§§6.20–6.22; <i>Mecano</i>; <i>Magtajas</i>). Liberal construction of LGU powers (Sec. 5(a)) resolves doubt only; it does not override a statute (Ch. VII).',
					application: 'The Charter speaks particularly and exclusively to vendor regulation within the port zone; the LGC speaks generally of LGU powers. They are harmonized: the city regulates vendors generally, except in the port zone, where the Authority\'s exclusive power governs. The LGC\'s general repealing clause does not name the Charter and shows no clear intent to repeal it. On the city\'s "later law" point: the LGC (1991) is actually <i>earlier</i> than the Charter (2000), so even <i>leges posteriores</i> favors the Charter; and a later general law would not repeal an earlier special law absent clear intent anyway. Sec. 5(a) and local autonomy cannot authorize an ordinance that contravenes a national statute.',
					conclusion: 'The ordinance cannot be enforced in the port zone; it remains valid elsewhere in the city to the extent consistent with law.'

				weaker: 'The city\'s three arguments (later law, liberal construction, local autonomy) are the three arguments rejected in <i>Magtajas</i>.'
