	roman: 'VI',
	title: 'Statute Construed as a Whole and in Relation to Other Statutes',
	short: 'Ch. VI — Statute as a Whole & Other Statutes',
	sections: '§§6.01–6.28 (section numbers as used in your earlier guide)',

	plain: `A statute is one piece of legislation, so you read each word in light of every other word in it. A statute also sits among other laws: the Constitution above it and other statutes beside it. So you read it in harmony with those too. The whole chapter rests on one presumption: <b>the legislature means its laws to fit together.</b>`,
	overview: `<p>Chapter VI has two halves. <b>Part A (§§6.01–6.13)</b> looks <i>inward</i>: how to read one provision in light of the rest of the same statute, how to reconcile provisions that seem to clash, and why no word should be left useless. <b>Part B (§§6.14–6.28)</b> looks <i>outward</i>: how to read a statute in harmony with the Constitution, with other statutes on the same subject (statutes <i>in pari materia</i>), with general or special laws, and with laws it refers to, supplements, reenacts or copies.</p>
<p>Why it matters: most real construction disputes are not about one word in a vacuum. They are about <b>which provision or which law controls</b>. All five of your assigned cases use a Chapter VI rule. <i>Catiis</i>, <i>Aquino</i> and <i>Manila Lodge</i> read one statute as a whole. <i>Corona</i> and <i>Magtajas</i> read two statutes together.</p>`,
	questions: [
		'How do I find the meaning of a provision when other provisions of the same statute bear on it?',
		'What do I do when two provisions of the same statute appear to conflict?',
		'When a statute can be read two ways, which reading does the Constitution require?',
		'When are two statutes <i>in pari materia</i>, and what follows if they are?',
		'When a general law and a special law collide, which prevails, and when does that answer flip?',
		'What happens to a law that refers to, supplements, reenacts or copies another law?'
	],
	keyPoints: [
		'Read the statute as a whole; one part may be qualified by another part.',
		'<b>Harmonize first.</b> Choose between provisions or laws only when harmony is impossible.',
		'A special provision or law is an exception to a general one, <b>whichever came first</b>, subject to three exceptions.',
		'Of two possible readings, adopt the one that keeps the statute constitutional, but only if the text is fairly open to it.',
		'Statutes <i>in pari materia</i> are read together as one system; the legislature is presumed to know existing laws.',
		'A reenacted statute carries its settled construction; an adopted (foreign) statute carries the foreign construction made <i>before</i> adoption.'
	],
	connects: `Chapters IV–V tell you what a word means; Chapter VI tells you how that meaning is shaped by the rest of the statute and by other laws. Chapter VI also sets up Chapter X: when harmonizing fails, the question becomes whether one law repealed the other. The presumption against implied repeal (Ch. X) is the other side of the duty to harmonize (Ch. VI). And §6.14 (harmony with the Constitution) previews Chapter XI.`,
	objectives: [
		'State the whole-statute rule and use it to defeat an argument that isolates one word (<i>Catiis</i>).',
		'Enumerate, in order, the steps for resolving apparently conflicting provisions of one statute.',
		'Define statutes <i>in pari materia</i>, give the three tests, and explain why they are harmonized.',
		'Apply <i>generalia specialibus non derogant</i> and its three exceptions, whichever law is later.',
		'Explain the rule of constitutional harmony and its limit.',
		'Distinguish reference, supplemental, reenacted and adopted statutes and state the rule for each.',
		'Connect each of the five cases to the correct Chapter VI rule.'

			term: 'Statute construed as a whole',
			plain: 'Read the whole law, not one sentence or word, to find what it means.',
			legal: 'Legislative intent is ascertained from the statute as a whole and not from an isolated part, section, phrase or word; every part is interpreted with reference to its context (<i>Aisporna v. CA</i>, quoted in <i>Aquino v. Quezon City</i>).',
			why: 'A legislature enacts a statute as a single, coherent scheme. A part read alone can mean something the legislature never intended.',
			example: 'In <i>Catiis</i>, "any person or persons" in Sec. 1, P.D. 1689 could not be read apart from "committed by a syndicate consisting of five or more persons" in the same sentence.',
			confuse: '<i>Statutes in pari materia.</i> That rule reads <b>different statutes</b> together; this rule reads the <b>parts of one statute</b> together.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Harmonization (reconciliation) of provisions',
			plain: 'If two parts of a law seem to clash, look for a reading under which both work.',
			legal: 'Apparently conflicting provisions of the same statute must be reconciled and harmonized so that each is given effect (§6.05).',
			why: 'The legislature is presumed not to enact contradictory provisions in one law; consistency is "of prime importance" (§6.08).',
			example: 'One provision: medical board members are appointed from a list submitted by the PMA. Another allows reappointment of members whose terms expired. Read together, a member being <i>reappointed</i> need not be on a fresh PMA list (Agpalo\'s illustration in §6.05, per your earlier guide).',
			confuse: 'Choosing between provisions. Choosing is the fallback; reconciling comes first.'
		},
		{
			term: '<i>Interpretatio fienda est ut res magis valeat quam pereat</i>',
			plain: 'Interpret a law so that it works, not so that it fails.',
			legal: 'A statute is construed so as to give it effect and to uphold it rather than to render it, or any of its parts, inoperative or void.',
			why: 'Courts assume the legislature passed every provision to have some effect.',
			example: 'Of two readings, one of which leaves a section with nothing to do, choose the other.',
			confuse: '<i>Utile per inutile non vitiatur</i>, which saves the rest of a statute from a part that really is useless. This maxim stops you from <i>making</i> a part useless.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Rule against surplusage (no nugatory construction)',
			plain: 'Assume every word has a job.',
			legal: 'Effect must be given to every word, clause and sentence; a statute is construed so that no part becomes inoperative or superfluous (§§6.07, 6.10–6.11).',
			why: 'The legislature is presumed not to use words in vain.',
			example: 'In <i>Manila Lodge</i>, if the reclaimed land were the City\'s patrimonial property, the grant "hereby authorized ... to sell" the north-end hotel site would be superfluous. So the land was not patrimonial.',
			confuse: '<i>Surplusagium non nocet</i> ("surplusage does not harm"). That maxim applies only when words <i>really</i> add nothing: they are disregarded, and they do not invalidate the statute.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Special provision vs. general provision (same statute)',
			plain: 'Inside one law, the specific section is the exception to the broad section.',
			legal: 'Where a general and a special provision of the same statute cover the same matter, the special provision is read as an exception to the general one, which then governs only the cases the special provision does not reach (§6.06).',
			why: 'This gives effect to both provisions; neither is wasted.',
			example: 'Sec. 3 grants an honorarium to "all" health workers; Sec. 9 excludes those holding elective barangay posts. Sec. 9 is the exception.',
			confuse: 'Special <i>law</i> vs. general <i>law</i> (§6.20), which is the same idea applied between two different statutes and has its own exceptions (§6.22).'
		},
		{
			term: 'Construction in harmony with the Constitution',
			plain: 'If a law can be read two ways, pick the way that keeps it constitutional.',
			legal: 'A statute is construed in harmony with, not in violation of, the Constitution. If it is fairly susceptible of two constructions, one making it unconstitutional, the court adopts the one that sustains it (§6.14).',
			why: 'The legislature is presumed to have acted within the Constitution, and every intendment favors validity.',
			example: '<i>Garcia v. COMELEC</i>: "ordinance" in the local-initiative provisions was not read so narrowly as to exclude resolutions, because the Constitution speaks of "any act or law."',
			confuse: 'Construing the Constitution itself (Ch. XI). This rule is about reading a <i>statute</i> against the Constitution.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Statutes <i>in pari materia</i>',
			plain: '"On the same matter." Laws on the same subject are read together as if they were one law.',
			legal: 'Statutes are <i>in pari materia</i> when they relate to the same person or thing, have the same purpose or object, or cover the same specific subject matter; they are construed together and harmonized (§§6.15–6.16).',
			why: 'The legislature is presumed to know existing laws and not to create two hostile systems on one subject (§6.17).',
			example: '<i>Corona</i>: the PPA Charter and the Civil Service Law both govern discipline of PPA personnel, so they were harmonized into one two-stage scheme.',
			confuse: 'Two laws merely in the same broad field (e.g., both "tax laws") are not <i>in pari materia</i> if their specific subjects differ.'
		},
		{
			term: '<i>Generalia specialibus non derogant</i>',
			plain: 'A general law does not override a special law.',
			legal: 'Where a general law and a special law on the same subject conflict, the special law prevails as an exception to the general law, whichever was passed first (§§6.20–6.21), subject to the exceptions in §6.22.',
			why: 'In making the special law the legislature focused on particular facts; it is not presumed to have undone that by a later general law that never mentions them (§6.21).',
			example: '<i>Magtajas</i>: the later, general Local Government Code did not repeal the earlier, special P.D. 1869 (PAGCOR Charter).',
			confuse: '<i>Leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant</i> (later laws repeal earlier contrary laws). That rule turns on <b>time</b>; this one turns on <b>specificity</b>.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Reference statute',
			plain: 'A law that borrows another law by pointing to it.',
			legal: 'A statute that refers to another law and makes it applicable to its own subject. The adopted law becomes part of the adopting law as if incorporated in full, and is taken as it stood at the time of adoption, not as later changed, unless the adopting law expressly says otherwise (§6.23).',
			why: 'It avoids repeating long provisions while fixing the borrowed rule at a known point in time.',
			example: 'The Science Stamp Tax Act collected its tax "in the same manner and subject to the same penalties" as the documentary stamp tax, so NIRC penalties for counterfeit documentary stamps cover counterfeit science stamps.',
			confuse: 'Supplemental statute, which adds to a law; a reference statute borrows from a law.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Supplemental statute',
			plain: 'A law that fills gaps in an existing law without rewriting it.',
			legal: 'A statute that supplies deficiencies in an existing law, adding to, completing or extending it without changing its text; it is read together with the original as one whole (§6.24).',
			why: '"No law can be viewed in isolation or as the beginning of a new legal system" (<i>Manila Jockey Club v. CA</i>).',
			example: 'R.A. 309 was silent on who gets horse-race "breakages"; Executive Orders 88 and 89 allocated them. The two were harmonized.',
			confuse: 'An amendment, which changes the text of the existing law (Ch. X).'
		},
		{
			term: 'Reenacted statute',
			plain: 'A law that repeats an older law, and so inherits how courts read the older law.',
			legal: 'A statute that reproduces an earlier statute in the same or substantially the same words. The legislature is presumed to have adopted the earlier settled judicial (or practical) construction along with the words (§§6.25–6.27).',
			why: 'Lawmakers who copy words that courts have already construed are presumed to accept that construction.',
			example: '<i>Montelibano v. Ferrer</i>: a provision of the Manila Charter on the city fiscal, already construed by the Court, was copied into the Bacolod Charter and carried the same construction.',
			confuse: 'A mere amendment. Changed wording suggests changed meaning; the presumption needs substantially the same words.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Adopted statute',
			plain: 'A law copied from a foreign law, which carries the foreign courts\' reading.',
			legal: 'A statute patterned after or copied from a foreign law. The construction given by the foreign courts <b>before</b> adoption is presumed adopted; rulings made <b>after</b> adoption are only persuasive (§6.28).',
			why: 'The legislature is presumed to take the foreign law as it was then understood.',
			example: 'If Congress copies a U.S. statute word for word, U.S. decisions construing it before the copying are presumed part of our law.',
			confuse: 'Reenacted statute, which repeats a <i>Philippine</i> law and carries <i>Philippine</i> construction.'

	principles: [
		{
			name: 'Construe the statute as a whole',
			rule: 'The intent of a statute is found in the statute as a whole, not in an isolated part. A word, phrase or section is read with the sentence, section and chapter to which it belongs, because one portion may be qualified by another.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§6.01–6.04; <i>Aisporna v. CA</i>, 113 SCRA 459 (1982), quoted in <i>Aquino v. Quezon City</i> (2006); <i>Catiis v. CA</i> (2006): "it is a dangerous practice to base construction upon only a part of a section since one portion may be qualified by the other portion."',
			why: 'A statute is enacted as one plan. Meaning depends on context.',
			when: 'Whenever a party builds an argument on one word or one section, or when a provision\'s placement (chapter heading, order of sections, cross-references) bears on its reach.',
			limits: 'Reading as a whole <b>explains</b> the text; it does not license adding a requirement the text omits. In <i>Aquino</i> the Court read Sec. 65 with the whole chapter, yet refused to add an "actual receipt" requirement to Sec. 73. If the provision, read in context, is clear, it is applied as written.',
			differs: 'In pari materia reads different statutes together; the whole-statute rule reads the parts of one statute together.',
			example: '<i>Catiis</i>: "any person or persons" + "a syndicate consisting of five or more persons" + "when not committed by a syndicate <i>as above defined</i>" in the second paragraph = four accused cannot commit syndicated estafa.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Reconcile apparently conflicting provisions; choose only as a last resort',
			rule: 'Apparently conflicting provisions of the same statute are harmonized so each has effect. If they are truly irreconcilable, the court prefers the provision that best fits the general plan and purpose of the statute; if there is no basis for choice, the provision <b>last in position</b> prevails as the latest expression of the legislative will.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§6.05, 6.07–6.08 (the same order is stated for codes in §10.12).',
			why: 'The legislature is presumed to enact consistent provisions; a construction that destroys one provision defeats part of what was enacted.',
			when: 'Two provisions of the same statute seem to command different results for the same situation.',
			limits: 'The last-in-position rule is a last resort and yields when a contrary legislative intent clearly appears. Never jump to choosing before honestly trying to reconcile.',
			differs: 'Between two <i>different</i> statutes the fallbacks are <i>generalia specialibus</i> (§6.20) and <i>leges posteriores</i> (Ch. X), not "last in position."',
			example: 'A licensing act says in Sec. 4 that a license is valid one year and in Sec. 15 that it is valid three years. If the statute\'s plan (annual inspections, annual fees) presupposes one year, Sec. 4 prevails even though Sec. 15 comes later.'
		},
		{
			name: 'A special provision is an exception to a general provision',
			rule: 'Where a general and a special provision in the same statute deal with the same matter, the special provision is treated as an exception to the general provision, and the general provision governs the remaining cases.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §6.06.',
			why: 'Both provisions are given effect; the specific one reflects the legislature\'s closer attention to the particular case.',
			when: 'One section states a broad rule and another, in the same law, deals particularly with part of the same ground.',
			limits: 'Yields if the statute clearly shows a different intent (for example, an express "notwithstanding" clause in the general provision).',
			differs: 'Same logic as <i>generalia specialibus</i> between two laws, but within one enactment there is no question of timing.',
			example: 'Driver\'s-license law: Sec. 2 bars licenses below 18; Sec. 9 allows student permits from 16 if accompanied by a licensed adult. Sec. 9 is the exception; Sec. 2 governs everyone else.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Give effect to every word; avoid nugatory readings — but surplusage does not vitiate',
			rule: 'A statute is construed so that no word, clause or provision is rendered useless. But if words truly add nothing, they are disregarded and do not invalidate the statute (<i>utile per inutile non vitiatur</i>; <i>surplusagium non nocet</i>).',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§6.07, 6.10–6.11; <i>Manila Lodge No. 761 v. CA</i> (1976), citing Sutherland: "effect must be given to every word, clause, and sentence of the statute."',
			why: 'The legislature is presumed not to waste words. And a drafting excess should not destroy an otherwise good law.',
			when: 'One reading would make a word, clause or section meaningless.',
			limits: 'The presumption that every word counts yields when a word is plainly redundant or a clerical slip (Ch. IV). It never lets a court invent a meaning that contradicts the text just to avoid redundancy.',
			differs: 'The anti-surplusage rule shapes <i>meaning</i>; <i>surplusagium non nocet</i> addresses <i>validity</i> when redundancy is real.',
			example: '<i>Manila Lodge</i>: "hereby authorized ... to lease ... to sell" would be pointless if the City already owned the land as private property, so the land was public dominion.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Construe the statute in harmony with the Constitution',
			rule: 'If a statute is fairly susceptible of two constructions, one of which would make it unconstitutional, the court adopts the construction that keeps it valid. Courts may even depart from "the more usual or apparent import of the language" to avoid unconstitutionality (<i>In re Guarina</i>, as cited by Agpalo).',
			basis: 'Agpalo §6.14; <i>Garcia v. COMELEC</i>, 237 SCRA 279 (1994); Art. 7, par. 2, Civil Code (a law inconsistent with the Constitution is void).',
			why: 'The legislature is presumed to follow the Constitution; courts avoid striking down a co-equal branch\'s act when a valid reading exists.',
			when: 'Genuine ambiguity, and one of the possible readings raises a constitutional problem.',
			limits: '<b>Only when the text is fairly susceptible of the saving reading.</b> A court cannot rewrite a clear provision. If the only reasonable reading is unconstitutional, the statute is void.',
			differs: 'This is a rule for choosing between readings of a statute. It is not the same as the rules for construing the Constitution itself (Ch. XI).',
			example: '<i>Garcia v. COMELEC</i>: a sanggunian resolution may be the subject of a local initiative. The Constitution (Art. VI, Sec. 32) speaks of "any act or law," R.A. 6735 expressly includes resolutions, and the LGC extends initiative to all subjects within the sanggunian\'s power.'

X).',

As in <i>Magtajas</i>, the earlier special law is not repealed by the later general law.',
				conclusion: 'The direct-negotiation purchase made during the declared calamity is valid.'

			title: 'Ch. VI — The rally permit',
			facts: 'R.A. No. 12400 (hypothetical) provides: "The city or municipal mayor may deny a permit for a public assembly in a public place when the assembly may disturb public order." A mayor denies a permit for a peaceful rally of 200 tricycle drivers, reasoning that any rally "may" cause traffic and therefore "may disturb public order." Assume that under the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, a permit for a public assembly may be denied only on a showing of a clear and present danger of a serious evil to public order. The statute can reasonably be read either way: as allowing denial whenever any disturbance is possible, or only when there is a clear and present danger of serious public disorder.',
			q: 'How should the court construe the statute, and was the denial valid? Answer using ALAC.',
			alac: {
				answer: 'The court should adopt the narrower reading, which keeps the statute constitutional. Under that reading, the denial was invalid.',
				legalBasis: 'A statute must be construed in harmony with, not in violation of, the Constitution. Where a statute is fairly susceptible of two constructions, one of which would make it unconstitutional, the court adopts the construction that sustains its validity (Agpalo §6.14; <i>Garcia v. COMELEC</i>). The legislature is presumed to have intended a constitutional law. The rule applies only where the text is fairly open to the saving reading.',
				application: '"May disturb public order" is open to both readings. The broad reading lets a mayor bar almost any assembly and conflicts with the clear-and-present-danger standard given in the facts. The narrow reading fits the words and keeps the statute valid, so the court must adopt it. A peaceful rally whose only expected effect is traffic does not present a clear and present danger of serious disorder.',
				conclusion: 'The statute stands as construed, but the denial is invalid; the permit should be granted, subject to reasonable regulation.'
			},
			weaker: 'Striking the statute down ignores the duty to adopt a saving construction; reading it broadly ignores the presumption that Congress intended a constitutional law.'

			title: 'Ch. VI — The river basin authority\'s summary dismissal',
			facts: 'R.A. No. 9001 (hypothetical, 2018), the charter of the "Mindanao River Basin Authority" (MRBA), states in one sentence: "Officers and employees of the Authority may be disciplined for cause in accordance with law." The Civil Service Law, a general law enacted earlier, contains detailed rules on who investigates, the grounds, the procedure, the penalties and the appeal route. Citing its charter as a "special law," the MRBA Board adopts its own summary procedure allowing dismissal without formal investigation and dismisses Engr. Dela Cruz under it.',
			q: 'Does the MRBA charter, as a special law, displace the Civil Service Law\'s detailed disciplinary procedure? Discuss using ALAC, and contrast <i>Corona v. CA</i>.',
			alac: {
				answer: 'No. On the disputed point the charter states only a general rule, so the Civil Service Law\'s specific procedure governs.',
				legalBasis: '<i>Generalia specialibus non derogant</i> applies only when the general law treats the subject in general and the special law treats it in particular. The special law does not prevail where it merely establishes a general rule while the general law creates a specific rule (Agpalo §6.22). Statutes <i>in pari materia</i> are read together, and the legislature is presumed to legislate with existing laws in mind (§6.17; <i>Corona</i>).',
				application: 'The charter\'s one sentence ("may be disciplined for cause in accordance with law") lays down only a general rule and itself points back to existing law. On the specific point in dispute, the procedure for discipline, it is the Civil Service Law that speaks in particular. The two laws are complementary, not conflicting: the charter makes MRBA personnel subject to discipline; the Civil Service Law supplies how. Contrast <i>Corona</i>: there the PPA Charter <i>specifically</i> lodged the power to "appoint and remove" in the PPA General Manager, a particular rule on the point, so it prevailed at the original stage.',
				conclusion: 'The summary dismissal under the Board\'s self-made procedure is invalid; the Civil Service Law\'s procedure must be followed.'

			title: 'Ch. VI — One year or three?',
			facts: 'The (hypothetical) "Small Food Stall Licensing Act" declares in Section 1 a policy of "annual review of food stalls for public health." Section 4 says a stall license "shall be valid for one (1) year." Section 10 requires the city health office to inspect each licensed stall "before each yearly renewal," and Section 11 fixes an "annual license fee." Section 15, the last operative section, says a license "shall be valid for three (3) years." Nothing else explains the discrepancy, and the legislative record is silent. Mang Ben\'s license was issued in January 2025. In February 2026 he is cited for operating without a renewed license. He invokes Section 15.',
			q: 'Which provision governs? Explain the steps the court should follow, using ALAC.',
			alac: {
				answer: 'Section 4 governs: the license is valid for one year, so Mang Ben\'s license had expired in January 2026.',
				legalBasis: 'Apparently conflicting provisions of the same statute are first reconciled. If irreconcilable, the court prefers the provision that best fits the general plan and purpose of the statute; only if there is no ground to choose does the provision last in position prevail (Agpalo §6.05; §10.12). A statute is read as a whole, and a construction that leaves other provisions idle is avoided.',
				application: 'Step 1: the provisions cannot be reconciled. Both fix the validity of the same license (one year vs. three), and nothing suggests they cover different classes of license. Step 2: the statute\'s plan points clearly to one year. The declared policy of annual review (Sec. 1), yearly inspection before renewal (Sec. 10) and the annual fee (Sec. 11) all presuppose a one-year license, and Section 15 would leave Sections 10 and 11 largely without work. Step 3 (last in position) is never reached, because there is a clear ground for choice.',
				conclusion: 'Section 4 prevails. Mang Ben was operating without a valid license in February 2026.'
