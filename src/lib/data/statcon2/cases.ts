		facts: `<p>Regino Sy Catiis complained that Reynaldo Patacsil, Enrico Lopez, Luzviminda Portuguez and Margielyn Tafalla induced him and others to deliver at least <b>US$123,461.14</b> by falsely representing that they were engaged in legitimate foreign-exchange trading through Asia Profits Philippines, Inc., Winggold Management Philippines, Inc., Belkin Management Consultancy, Inc. and/or Belkin Profits Limited. The prosecutor charged them with syndicated estafa under Art. 315(2)(a) of the RPC in relation to P.D. 1689 and recommended no bail.</p>
<p>The Information named <b>only four accused</b> but alleged that they conspired "in a syndicated manner consisting of five (5) or more persons." It alleged <b>no aggravating circumstance</b>. Under Sec. 1 of P.D. 1689, estafa committed by "a syndicate consisting of five or more persons" is punished by life imprisonment to death; when "not committed by a syndicate as above defined," the penalty is reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua if the fraud exceeds ₱100,000.</p>
<p>Judge Bersamin first denied bail, then reconsidered and fixed bail. The accused (except Tafalla, who was at large) posted surety bonds before Executive Judge Zenarosa and were released the same day. The CA found no grave abuse of discretion, and Catiis came to the Supreme Court.</p>`,

		issues: [
			{ q: 'Does "any person or persons" in Sec. 1, P.D. 1689 permit the prosecution of fewer than five persons, even one, for syndicated estafa punishable by life imprisonment to death?', v: 'NO', a: 'The phrase cannot be read apart from the definition of "syndicate" in the same sentence. Syndicated estafa requires five or more persons; reading "any person" alone to mean one person may be charged with it "is contrary to the provision of the law."' },
			{ q: 'Does an Information naming only four accused, but alleging that they acted "in a syndicated manner consisting of five (5) or more persons," sufficiently charge estafa by a syndicate?', v: 'NO', a: 'The allegation does not comply with the statutory definition. The accusatory portion charged only four persons and named no other participant; "if the government has chosen to indict only four persons, without more, the obvious reason is that only the persons actually charged were involved." The first paragraph does not apply.' },
			{ q: 'Is estafa under the second paragraph of Sec. 1 (reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua) bailable as a matter of right where no aggravating circumstance is alleged?', v: 'YES', a: 'Under Rule 110, Secs. 8–9, aggravating circumstances must be specifically alleged or they cannot be considered even if proved (<i>People v. Casitas</i>; <i>People v. Bragat</i>). Only reclusion temporal is imposable, so bail is a matter of right (Art. III, Sec. 13; Rule 114, Sec. 4). The order did not prejudge the case; it rested only on the face of the Information.' },
			{ q: 'Did the Executive Judge validly approve the bail bonds under Rule 114, Sec. 17(a) although Branch 96 was open?', v: 'YES', a: 'The rule speaks of the judge\'s "absence or unavailability," not the branch\'s. That the branch was open does not show the judge was available "at that precise moment." The petitioner\'s unsworn, imprecise allegation did not rebut the presumption of regularity (Rule 131, Sec. 3(m)).' }

		ratio: {
			doctrine: 'A statute must be read as a whole, and a single word cannot be construed apart from the sentence that qualifies it; where the law itself defines a term, the definition controls and is simply applied.',
			plain: 'The law says a syndicate means five or more people, in the very sentence that begins "any person or persons." So "any person" cannot mean one person. Four accused are not a syndicate, whatever label the Information uses.',
			wording: 'Sec. 1, P.D. 1689: "...life imprisonment to death if the swindling (estafa) is committed by a syndicate consisting of five or more persons..." and "When not committed by a syndicate as above defined, the penalty imposable shall be reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua if the amount of the fraud exceeds 100,000 pesos."',
			why: 'The law is "clear and free from any doubt or ambiguity," so it needs no construction; where a requirement is explicit, no discretion is left to the courts (<i>Luzon Surety v. De Garcia</i>). "It is a dangerous practice to base construction upon only a part of a section since one portion may be qualified by the other portion." The "as above defined" clause in the second paragraph confirms the definition is the operative test.',
			rejected: 'The singular reading of "any person" would erase the condition attached to the penalty and leave the second paragraph with little room to operate. <i>People v. Romero</i> did not help the petitioner: the one-person question was not in issue there, and the Court in <i>Romero</i> itself refused the heavier penalty for failure to prove a syndicate. The argument that bail depends only on the prescribed penalty was not adopted.',
			lesson: 'Read the whole sentence and the whole section; apply a statutory definition as written; labels in a pleading yield to the statute\'s elements; and read the penal law together with the procedural rules (Rules 110 and 114) to reach the practical result.'
		},
		beginner: {
			oneLine: 'The complainant wanted four accused held without bail for "syndicated" estafa, but the law defines a syndicate as five or more, so the heavier, non-bailable charge could not stand.',
			issue: 'Can the words "any person" in the syndicated-estafa law mean that one to four people can commit syndicated estafa?',
			answer: 'No. Read the whole sentence: the heavier penalty applies only to a syndicate of five or more.',
			analogy: 'A rule says, "Any student who joins a relay team of five or more runners may enter the race." Four students cannot enter as a "team of five" just by writing "five" on the form.',
			memorize: 'A statute is read as a whole; one part may be qualified by another; a statutory definition controls.',

The Information named only four accused, although it alleged that they acted "in a syndicated manner consisting of five (5) or more persons," and alleged no aggravating circumstance. Judge Bersamin first approved the no-bail recommendation but later ruled that four accused cannot constitute a syndicate, so the offense was bailable; the accused posted bail before the Executive Judge.

			ruling: '(1) No. The law must be read as a whole, since one part of a section may be qualified by another, and "any person" is qualified by the same sentence, which defines a syndicate as five or more persons. The definition is clear and controlling, so courts simply apply it. Since only four were charged, the second paragraph applies (reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua). (2) Yes. Aggravating circumstances must be alleged in the Information under Rule 110, Secs. 8 and 9; none was alleged, so only reclusion temporal may be imposed, and bail is a matter of right.

Reading "any person" alone would erase that condition.'],
			['How would the result change if five persons had been named and an aggravating circumstance alleged?', 'With five named persons satisfying the definition, the first paragraph could apply (life imprisonment to death), and bail would no longer be a matter of right; it would depend on whether evidence of guilt is strong. Even under the second paragraph, an alleged aggravating circumstance could support the maximum, reclusion perpetua, again making bail discretionary.'],
			['How did the Court deal with People v. Romero?', 'It held petitioner\'s reliance misleading: <i>Romero</i> did not decide whether one person could be indicted for syndicated estafa, and it actually refused the heavier penalty because no syndicate was proved.

The City Treasurer sold the lot at public auction on February 29, 1984 to Aida Linao, who later consolidated ownership. The only compliance with Sec. 65 of P.D. 464 was a Notice of Intent to Sell sent by registered mail to the Aquinos' last known address (which they said they had abandoned); the notice of delinquency was not posted or published. The Aquinos sued to annul the sale for lack of notice.</p>

		facts: `<p>Under A.O. No. 25, DOTC Secretary Rainerio Reyes created the Administrative Action Board to act on graft cases in the Department. On August 26, 1988, two PPA police officers filed with the AAB a complaint against Leopoldo Bungubung, District Manager of the Port of Manila. On the same day, Secretary Reyes himself filed a complaint with the AAB against Cristeto Dinopol, Port Manager of Davao. The PPA General Manager also filed charges against both and indorsed them to the AAB. The AAB found Dinopol guilty and dismissed him.</p>
<p>Both officials objected that, under Sec. 8 of the PPA Charter (P.D. 857), the PPA General Manager has the power to remove personnel below the rank of Assistant General Manager. The DOTC relied on Sec. 37(b) of the Civil Service Law (P.D. 807), which gives "heads of departments" jurisdiction over disciplinary matters. The CA held that the DOTC Secretary had no jurisdiction.</p>`,
		args: `<b>Petitioners (DOTC officials):</b> the CA deprived the Secretary, as alter ego of the President, of control and supervision over personnel actions in the PPA; Dinopol submitted to the AAB\'s jurisdiction (<i>Tijam v. Sibonghanoy</i>); respondents failed to exhaust administrative remedies.`,
		issues: [
			{ q: 'Does the DOTC Secretary, as alter ego of the President, or the AAB have jurisdiction to initiate and hear administrative cases against PPA personnel below the rank of Assistant General Manager?', v: 'NO', a: 'Following <i>Beja, Sr. v. CA</i>, complaints must be filed with and investigated by the PPA General Manager, whose penalty requires PPA Board approval. The Secretary has only appellate jurisdiction (the employee may appeal to him or directly to the CSC). He cannot initiate the case, or he would be reviewing his own complaint on appeal.' },
			{ q: 'Does Sec. 8 of the PPA Charter, a special law, prevail over Sec. 37(b) of the Civil Service Law, a general law, on this point?', v: 'YES', a: 'A later special law inconsistent with a prior general law on the same subject impliedly repeals it to the extent of the inconsistency, or grafts an exception onto it. The laws, being <i>in pari materia</i>, are harmonized: the PPA Charter delimits, but does not abolish, the Secretary\'s general power over attached agencies.' },
			{ q: 'Has the DOTC Secretary completely lost control and supervision over disciplinary matters involving these employees, as the CA said?', v: 'NO', a: 'The CA\'s statement was "less than accurate." The Secretary is excluded only at the initial stage; on appeal, the Secretary, with the AAB, has "the ultimate say before recourse to the courts."' },
			{ q: 'Are respondents estopped from questioning the AAB\'s jurisdiction because they participated in its proceedings?', v: 'NO', a: 'Estoppel applies only where lack of jurisdiction was not raised early.

		disposition: 'Petition DENIED. The AAB decisions against Dinopol (AAB-006-88 and AAB-016-88) are declared NULL AND VOID. These and the cases against Bungubung (AAB-031-88 and Adm. Case No. 11-01-88) are REMANDED to the PPA General Manager for immediate reinvestigation.',

			plain: 'The Civil Service Law says department heads discipline their employees. The PPA Charter says the PPA General Manager removes PPA personnel below Assistant GM. The specific PPA law wins at the start: the case must begin with the GM. But both laws still work, because the employee can appeal to the DOTC Secretary afterward. The Secretary just cannot be the one who files the case and then judges it on appeal.',

Sec. 37(b), P.D. 807: heads of departments "shall have jurisdiction to investigate and decide matters involving disciplinary action against officers and employees under their jurisdiction."',
			why: 'The PPA Charter is special (only PPA personnel) and later (Dec. 23 vs. Oct. 6, 1975). The power to remove implies the power to investigate (<i>Beja</i>). The legislature is presumed to have had the prior statute in mind, so the Charter "delimited" the general power. The Administrative Code defines attachment as a "lateral relationship" for policy coordination, and a department may not act directly where a function is entrusted by law to a subordinate. Letting the Secretary initiate cases would produce the "absurd spectacle" of the complainant reviewing his own complaint (<i>nemo potest esse simul actor et judex</i>).',
			rejected: 'The CA\'s "sweeping statement" that the Secretary lost all control was corrected. The A.O. No. 25 "shortcut," though laudable, could not override the forum fixed by statute. Estoppel (<i>Tijam</i>) and non-exhaustion did not apply.',

			doctrine: 'A word takes its meaning from its companions (<i>noscitur a sociis</i>); implied repeals are disfavored, and courts must reconcile statutes rather than pit them against each other (<i>interpretare et concordare leges legibus</i>); a general law does not repeal a special law absent clear intent (<i>Lichauco</i>); an ordinance cannot contravene a statute, since the delegate cannot be superior to the principal.',
			plain: 'The LGC lets cities stamp out "gambling and other prohibited games of chance." The words "other prohibited" tell you the "gambling" meant is the illegal kind. PAGCOR casinos are legal under a national law the LGC did not repeal. A city ordinance cannot cancel a national law, so the casino ban was void.',
			wording: 'LGC Sec. 458(a)(1)(v): the sanggunian "shall ... enact ordinances intended to prevent, suppress and impose appropriate penalties for ... gambling and other prohibited games of chance..." Sec. 534(f): "All general and special laws ... decrees ... inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Code are hereby repealed or modified accordingly."',
			why: 'The word "other" links "gambling" to the class of "prohibited" games; the surrounding list (prostitution, drug addiction, fraudulent devices) is a list of unlawful activities. "Shall" is mandatory, so petitioners\' reading would require every LGU to ban legal gambling, leaving PAGCOR "a toothless tiger or a white elephant" and letting cities stop the PCSO lottery or the San Lazaro races. The specific list in Sec. 534(a)–(e) omits P.D. 1869. Later laws treat P.D. 1869 as alive. LGUs are "mere tenants at will of the legislature" (Dillon\'s rule language from <i>Clinton v. Cedar Rapids</i>), and local autonomy reduced but did not remove Congress\'s control.',
			rejected: '<i>Ubi lex non distinguit</i> did not apply because the law does distinguish ("prohibited"). The "modified pro tanto" theory was in substance a total repeal. Reliance on Sec. 534(f) alone ignored the rest of the provision.',

Amid public protests, the Sangguniang Panlungsod enacted Ordinance No. 3353, prohibiting business permits for casinos, and Ordinance No. 3375-93, prohibiting the operation of casinos, invoking its power under Sec. 458 of the Local Government Code to suppress "gambling and other prohibited games of chance." The CA declared both ordinances invalid. The City argued that the Code, a later law, had repealed or modified P.D. No. 1869 and allowed it to ban all forms of gambling.',
			issues: '(1) Whether "gambling" in Sec. 458 of the Local Government Code includes gambling authorized by law, such as PAGCOR casinos. (2) Whether the Code impliedly repealed P.D. No. 1869, making the ordinances valid.',
			ruling: '(1) No. Under noscitur a sociis, "gambling" is read with the words associated with it, "and other prohibited games of chance," so it refers only to illegal gambling. (2) No. P.D. No. 1869 is not among the laws specifically repealed by the Code, implied repeals are not favored, and later laws even draw funds from PAGCOR. Courts must harmonize statutes, so LGUs may suppress all gambling except that allowed by statutes like P.D. No. 1869.
