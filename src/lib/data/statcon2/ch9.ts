	title: 'Prospective and Retroactive Statutes',
	short: 'Ch. IX — Prospective & Retroactive Statutes',
	sections: '§§9.01–9.27 (section numbers as used in your earlier guide)',

	plain: `Laws look forward: they govern what happens <b>after</b> they take effect. A law reaches back to past acts or rights only if the legislature clearly says so, or if it is the kind of law that naturally reaches back: procedural laws, curative laws, and penal laws that help the accused. Even then, it cannot take away vested rights, impair contracts, deny due process, or punish past acts after the fact (ex post facto).`,
	overview: `<p><b>Part A (§§9.01–9.05)</b> defines retroactive laws, states the presumption that laws are prospective (Art. 4, Civil Code), and sets the constitutional limits on retroactivity. <b>Part B (§§9.06–9.16)</b> covers statutes given prospective effect: penal laws (with the ban on ex post facto laws and bills of attainder, and the exception for laws favorable to the accused), substantive laws, vested rights, jurisdiction and contracts. <b>Part C (§§9.17–9.27)</b> covers statutes given retroactive effect: procedural, curative and remedial laws, and laws on prescription. The chapter closes with the effect of judicial decisions: the Supreme Court\'s interpretation is part of the law from its enactment, but a doctrine that is <i>overruled</i> is changed only prospectively.</p>
<p>Exam questions in this chapter almost always turn on <b>two questions in order</b>: (1) Did the legislature intend retroactivity, expressly or because of the law\'s nature? (2) If so, does retroactivity hit a constitutional wall: a vested right, a contract, due process, or the ex post facto clause?</p>`,
	questions: [
		'What is a retroactive law, and why are laws presumed prospective?',
		'When may a statute validly operate retroactively?',
		'What is an ex post facto law? A bill of attainder?',
		'When do penal laws apply retroactively, and to whom do they not apply?',
		'What are vested rights, and why do they block retroactivity?',
		'Why do procedural and curative laws apply to pending cases, and when do they not?',
		'What happens to those who relied on a doctrine the Supreme Court later abandons?'
	],
	keyPoints: [
		'Art. 4, Civil Code: laws have no retroactive effect unless the contrary is provided; in doubt, against retroactivity.',
		'Retroactivity is valid unless it impairs contracts, takes property without due process, divests vested rights, or is ex post facto.',
		'Penal laws are prospective, but retroactive if favorable to an accused who is not a habitual criminal, even after final judgment (Art. 22, RPC).',
		'The ex post facto ban is limited to criminal or penal matters.',
		'Procedural laws apply to pending cases (no vested right in procedure), subject to exceptions.',
		'Curative statutes may operate retroactively if they do not impair vested rights or contracts; police-power measures may go further.',
		'An overruled doctrine is replaced prospectively: those who relied on it in good faith are protected (<i>Jabinal</i>; <i>Co v. CA</i>).'
	],
	connects: `Chapter IX is the time dimension of construction. It links to Chapter VII (penal laws strictly construed; prescription of crimes liberally construed), to Chapter X (amendments and repeals also operate prospectively; the effects of repeal on vested rights and pending cases), and to Chapter II (stare decisis; <i>legis interpretatio legis vim obtinet</i>). None of the five assigned cases turns on retroactivity; see part 8.`,
	objectives: [
		'Define a retroactive law and state the presumption of prospectivity with its basis.',
		'Enumerate the constitutional limits on retroactive legislation.',
		'Enumerate the six kinds of ex post facto laws and the elements of a bill of attainder.',
		'Apply Art. 22 of the RPC and its exceptions, including the remedy after final judgment.',
		'Explain why procedural and curative laws apply retroactively, and the exceptions.',
		'Distinguish judicial interpretation (retroactive to enactment) from overruling (prospective).',
		'Solve an ALAC problem involving a favorable penal law and a habitual delinquent.'

	concepts: [
		{
			term: 'Prospective statute',
			plain: 'A law that covers only what happens after it takes effect.',
			legal: 'A statute that operates on acts, transactions and rights arising after its effectivity. All statutes are presumed prospective (§§9.01–9.03).',
			why: 'People should be judged by the law in force when they acted.',
			example: 'A 2025 law banning plastic straws "effective upon publication" cannot be used to fine a restaurant for 2024 sales.',
			confuse: 'A law that merely <i>affects</i> past facts in shaping future consequences; using past facts as a basis for future regulation is not necessarily retroactive.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Retroactive statute (legal sense)',
			plain: 'A law that reaches back and changes the legal effect of what already happened.',
			legal: 'One that takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability in respect of transactions or considerations already past (§9.01).',
			why: 'Defining it this way identifies what fairness forbids: changing the rules after people relied on them.',
			example: 'A law reducing retirement bonuses already earned and paid under the old law.',
			confuse: 'Ex post facto law, which is only the <i>criminal</i> kind of retroactive law.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Presumption of prospectivity',
			plain: 'When in doubt, the law looks forward.',
			legal: '"Laws shall have no retroactive effect, unless the contrary is provided" (Art. 4, Civil Code). All laws operate prospectively unless the contrary is clearly, plainly and unequivocally expressed or necessarily implied; doubt is resolved against retroactivity. The presumption covers original enactments, amendments and repeals (§§9.02–9.03).',
			why: 'Retroactivity upsets settled expectations and can be unjust.',
			example: 'Phrases like "from and after its approval" confirm prospectivity (§9.04).',
			confuse: 'A constitutional ban. The Constitution does not forbid retroactive laws as such; it forbids certain effects (§9.05).'
		},
		{
			term: 'Vested right',
			plain: 'A right that is already fully yours, not just hoped for.',
			legal: 'A right that has become fixed and established, no longer open to doubt or controversy, and that the law protects from impairment by later legislation. There is no vested right in a rule of law staying unchanged, in a particular remedy or procedure, or in the omission to legislate; inchoate rights not yet acted on are not vested (§§9.10–9.13).',
			why: 'Retroactive laws are tolerable only so long as they do not take away what people already own.',
			example: 'A retirement bonus already earned under the law in force at retirement.',
			confuse: 'An expectation, such as hoping a tax rate will stay low.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Ex post facto law',
			plain: 'A law that punishes, or punishes more, something done before the law existed.',
			legal: 'A law that, in criminal matters, (1) makes criminal an act innocent when done; (2) aggravates a crime; (3) inflicts a greater penalty; (4) alters the rules of evidence to convict on less or different testimony; (5) under the guise of regulating civil rights, imposes a penalty or deprivation for an act lawful when done; or (6) deprives the accused of a lawful protection already acquired, such as a former acquittal or amnesty. Prohibited by Art. III, Sec. 22 (§9.07).',
			why: 'Fair warning: no one should be punished under rules made after the act.',
			example: 'A 2026 law raising the penalty for estafa cannot apply to estafa committed in 2025.',
			confuse: 'Retroactive civil laws. The ex post facto clause covers only criminal or penal matters; civil retroactivity is tested by due process and the contract clause.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Bill of attainder',
			plain: 'A law that declares people guilty and punishes them without a trial.',
			legal: 'A legislative act that inflicts punishment without judicial trial; its essence is the substitution of a legislative for a judicial determination of guilt (§9.08; <i>People v. Ferrer</i>, 48 SCRA 382 (1972)).',
			why: 'Separation of powers: only courts adjudge guilt.',
			example: '<i>Ferrer</i> upheld the Anti-Subversion Act because guilt still had to be proved at trial, and the Act operated prospectively.',
			confuse: 'Ex post facto law. A bill of attainder is also usually ex post facto; if a law is not ex post facto, that is persuasive that it is not a bill of attainder.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Favorable penal law (Art. 22, RPC)',
			plain: 'If the law later becomes kinder to the offender, the offender gets the benefit.',
			legal: '"Penal laws shall have a retroactive effect insofar as they favor the person guilty of a felony, who is not a habitual criminal, as this term is defined in Rule 5 of Article 62 of this Code, although at the time of the publication of such laws a final sentence has been pronounced and the convict is serving the same" (Art. 22, RPC; §9.09).',
			why: 'Justice and humanity: <i>favorabilia sunt amplianda, odiosa restringenda</i>.',
			example: 'A new law lowers the penalty for a theft amount: a non-habitual convict already serving sentence may benefit.',
			confuse: 'Habitual delinquents, who are excluded.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Procedural (adjective) law',
			plain: 'Rules on how to enforce rights in court, not on what the rights are.',
			legal: 'A law prescribing rules and forms of procedure for enforcing rights or obtaining redress. It applies to actions pending and undetermined at its passage, because no one has a vested right in procedure; in that sense it is retroactive (§9.19).',
			why: 'Procedure serves justice; better procedures should apply as soon as possible.',
			example: '<i>Subido v. Sandiganbayan</i>: R.A. 7975, amending P.D. 1606 on jurisdiction and procedure, applied to pending cases.',
			confuse: 'Substantive law, which creates or defines rights and is prospective.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Curative statute',
			plain: 'A law that fixes past defects so that acts or proceedings become valid.',
			legal: 'A statute that cures defects in prior acts or proceedings and adds to the means of enforcing existing obligations; it validates what the legislature could have authorized in the first place. It may be given retroactive effect if it does not impair vested rights or contract obligations (§§9.21–9.23).',
			why: 'To give effect to what the parties intended where only a technical defect stood in the way.',
			example: 'LGC Sec. 442(d) treats municipal districts created by presidential issuances as regular municipalities, curing the earlier defect in their creation.',
			confuse: 'Remedial statute in general. Every curative statute is remedial, but not every remedial statute cures a past defect.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Prospective overruling; <i>legis interpretatio legis vim obtinet</i>',
			plain: 'The Supreme Court\'s reading of a law counts as part of the law from the start, but if the Court changes its mind, the new reading applies only going forward.',
			legal: 'Judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws form part of the legal system (Art. 8, Civil Code), and the interpretation is deemed part of the law as of its enactment. But when a doctrine is overruled, the new doctrine operates prospectively and does not prejudice those who relied on the old one in good faith (<i>People v. Jabinal</i>; <i>Co v. CA</i>).',
			why: 'People must be able to rely on the law as the Court declared it when they acted.',
			example: '<i>Jabinal</i>: a secret agent who possessed a firearm while <i>Macarandang</i> exempted secret agents was acquitted even though <i>Mapa</i> later abandoned that doctrine.',
			confuse: 'A first interpretation of an unchanged statute, which is treated as having been the law all along.'

	principles: [
		{
			name: 'Laws are presumed prospective',
			rule: 'Laws have no retroactive effect unless the contrary is provided. A statute operates prospectively unless the intent to give it retroactive effect is clearly, plainly and unequivocally expressed or necessarily implied. Doubt is resolved against retroactivity. The presumption applies to original enactments, amendments and repeals.',

		{
			name: 'When retroactivity is permitted, and its constitutional limits',
			rule: 'The Constitution does not forbid retroactive laws as such. A statute may be retroactive if the legislature so intends and the statute does not (1) impair the obligation of contracts, (2) deprive a person of property without due process, (3) divest vested rights, or (4) amount to an ex post facto law. If a law expressly says it is retroactive, the only question is whether that violates the Constitution.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §9.05; Art. III, Secs. 1, 10 and 22, 1987 Constitution; Art. 2253, Civil Code (new rights); Art. 256, Family Code.',
			why: 'Legislative intent controls within constitutional bounds.',
			when: 'A law expressly provides for retroactivity, or is of a kind that is retroactive by nature.',
			limits: 'Retroactive laws cannot take away vested rights. The Family Code, for instance, is retroactive only "insofar as it does not prejudice or impair vested or acquired rights" (Art. 256). New rights declared for the first time apply at once only if they do not impair vested rights of the same origin (Art. 2253, Civil Code).',
			differs: 'Ex post facto is one of four limits, and it applies only in criminal matters.',
			example: 'A law creating a new right to support for illegitimate children may apply to children born before it, but cannot undo a partition of an estate already final.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Penal laws: no ex post facto laws or bills of attainder',
			rule: 'No ex post facto law or bill of attainder shall be enacted. An ex post facto law is limited to criminal or penal matters; the test is whether the law, applied retroactively, takes from an accused any right that was regarded at the time as vital to the protection of life and liberty. A bill of attainder inflicts punishment without judicial trial.',
			basis: 'Art. III, Sec. 22, 1987 Constitution; Agpalo §§9.06–9.08; <i>People v. Ferrer</i>, 48 SCRA 382 (1972); <i>In re Kay Villegas Kami</i>, 35 SCRA 429 (1970).',
			why: 'Fair warning, and only courts adjudge guilt.',
			when: 'A penal law is applied to acts done before its effectivity, or a law punishes a designated person or group without trial.',
			limits: 'Changes favorable to the accused are not ex post facto. Procedural changes that do not affect substantial rights of the accused are not ex post facto.',
			differs: 'Retroactive civil laws are tested under due process and the contract clause, not the ex post facto clause.',
			example: '<i>Ferrer</i>: the Anti-Subversion Act was neither ex post facto nor a bill of attainder, because it applied only to membership after its effectivity and guilt had to be proved in court.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Penal laws favorable to the accused are retroactive (Art. 22, RPC)',
			rule: 'Penal laws cannot be given retroactive effect, except when favorable to the accused. Favorable penal laws apply to persons guilty of a felony who are not habitual criminals, even if a final sentence has been pronounced and the convict is serving it.',
			basis: 'Art. 22, RPC; Agpalo §9.09.',
			why: 'Justice and humanity: if the State now thinks the act deserves less punishment, it should not keep punishing it more.',
			when: 'A later law reduces the penalty, decriminalizes the act, removes subsidiary imprisonment, adds mitigating or extinguishing grounds, or shortens prescription.',
			limits: 'Not applicable (1) to a habitual criminal (as defined in Art. 62(5)), (2) where the new law expressly says it does not apply to pending cases, and, per your earlier guide, (3) where the accused himself invokes the prior law. If the convict is already serving sentence, the remedy recognized in jurisprudence is a petition for habeas corpus.',
			differs: 'This is the mirror image of the ex post facto ban: unfavorable laws cannot reach back; favorable ones do.',
			example: 'Theft of property worth ₱15,000 is moved to a lighter penalty bracket by a new law: a first-time offender serving the old, heavier sentence may seek release once he has served the new maximum.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Substantive laws, vested rights, jurisdiction and contracts: prospective',
			rule: 'Substantive statutes are prospective. A statute may not be applied retroactively if it impairs a vested right, disturbs a right embodied in a judgment, creates new obligations for past transactions, or revives a right or liability already extinguished. A court that has acquired jurisdiction keeps it despite a later law transferring jurisdiction, unless the law provides otherwise expressly or by necessary implication. A law cannot impair the obligation of existing contracts.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§9.10–9.16; Art. III, Sec. 10, Constitution.',
			why: 'Fixed rights and pending proceedings deserve stability.',
			when: 'A new law is invoked against rights already acquired or against a court\'s pending case.',
			limits: 'No one has a vested right in a rule of law staying unchanged, in a remedy, or in the omission to legislate. Police-power measures may affect contracts (§§9.22–9.23).',
			differs: 'Procedural laws, by contrast, do apply to pending cases (§9.19).',
			example: 'Maria retired with a 10% bonus under the law then in force; a later law cutting future bonuses to 5% cannot reduce hers.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Procedural laws apply to pending actions',
			rule: 'Statutes regulating procedure are applicable to actions pending and undetermined at the time of their passage, because no one has a vested right in procedure or a particular remedy.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§9.17–9.20; <i>Subido v. Sandiganbayan</i> (R.A. 7975).',
			why: 'Procedure is a means to justice and does not create or take away rights.',
			when: 'A new rule of procedure takes effect while a case is pending.',
			limits: 'Not applied to pending cases when (1) the law expressly or impliedly provides otherwise, (2) application is not feasible or would work injustice, (3) it would involve intricate problems of due process or impair the independence of the courts, or (4) it would impair vested rights or contract obligations (§9.20).',

		{
			name: 'Curative and remedial statutes may be retroactive',

			why: 'To carry out what the parties intended where only a technical defect stood in the way.',
			when: 'A law "confirms," "validates" or "ratifies" past acts.',

			basis: 'Agpalo §§9.24–9.27; Art. 22, RPC; <i>People v. Moran</i>, 44 Phil. 387 (1923); <i>Yapdiangco v. Buencamino</i>, G.R. No. L-28841, June 24, 1983.',
			why: 'Time wears out proofs of innocence and guilt alike.',
			when: 'A dispute over whether a crime has prescribed, or whether a new prescriptive period applies.',
			limits: 'In <i>Yapdiangco</i>, the information for a light offense was filed on the 61st day because the 60th fell on a Sunday; the Court held the offense had prescribed. A Sunday or holiday does not extend the prescriptive period for criminal actions.',
			differs: 'The rule that a pleading due on a Sunday may be filed the next working day does not apply to prescription of crimes.',
			example: 'If a new law shortens the prescriptive period of an offense from 10 to 5 years, an accused whose offense was committed 6 years ago may invoke it.'

			limits: 'Only the Court en banc may modify or reverse a doctrine (Art. VIII, Sec. 4(3)). The protection is for good-faith reliance; it is strongest in criminal cases, where punishability must be foreseeable.',
			differs: 'A first interpretation of an unchanged statute is not a change of law and applies to past acts; an overruling is a change and does not.',
			example: '<i>Co v. CA</i>: Co issued a guarantee check in 1983, while a Ministry of Justice circular said such checks were outside B.P. 22. The later doctrine in <i>Que v. People</i> (1987) could not be applied to him.'
