	short: 'Ch. VII — Strict or Liberal Construction',
	sections: '§§7.01–7.38 (section numbers as used in your earlier guide)',

	plain: `How tightly a court reads a statute depends on what kind of statute it is. Laws that punish people, take their property or money, or give someone a special favor are read <b>strictly</b>: nothing beyond what the words clearly say. Laws meant to protect or help people are read <b>liberally</b>: generously, to reach their purpose. Neither approach lets a court rewrite a clear law.`,
	overview: `<p><b>Part A (§§7.01–7.06)</b> explains what strict and liberal construction mean, what decides which one applies (the statute's nature, its purpose, and the mischief it remedies), and the constitutional mandate of social justice. <b>Part B (§§7.07–7.25)</b> lists the statutes read <b>strictly</b>, and against whom. <b>Part C (§§7.26–7.38)</b> lists the statutes read <b>liberally</b>, and in whose favor.</p>
<p>Two ideas carry the whole chapter. First, <b>strict or liberal construction only matters when there is doubt</b>; a clear statute is applied as written. Second, <b>"strict" is always strict <i>against</i> someone</b>: against the State in penal laws, against the government in tax impositions, against the claimant in tax exemptions, against the grantee in privileges and grants. Learn the direction, not just the label.</p>`,
	questions: [
		'What do strict and liberal construction mean, and what do they <i>not</i> mean?',
		'What decides whether a statute is read strictly or liberally?',
		'Which statutes are read strictly, and against whom?',
		'Which statutes are read liberally, and in whose favor?',
		'How do the rules on tax laws, tax exemptions and local government powers differ?',
		'What are the limits of each approach?'
	],
	keyPoints: [
		'The nature of the statute, the purpose to be served and the mischief to be remedied decide the approach (§7.01).',
		'Both approaches operate only on <b>doubtful</b> language; a clear text is applied as written.',
		'Penal statutes: strictly against the State, liberally for the accused, but not so as to defeat the law\'s evident purpose (<i>People v. Purisima</i>).',
		'Tax impositions are read strictly against the government; tax exemptions are read <i>strictissimi juris</i> against the claimant; exceptions and provisos are read strictly too (<i>CIR v. CA</i>, Cenvoco).',
		'Grants of <b>property</b> to LGUs: strictly against the LGU (<i>Manila Lodge</i>). Grants of <b>powers</b> to LGUs: liberally in its favor (LGC Sec. 5(a)). But local <b>tax ordinances</b>: strictly against the LGU (Sec. 5(b)).',
		'Social legislation, amnesty, prescription of crimes, adoption and the Rules of Court are read liberally.'
	],
	connects: `Chapter VII answers "how far" a court may go once construction is allowed (Chapters II–IV). It overlaps with Chapter VIII: requirements read strictly (jurisdictional steps, conditions of privileges) are usually also mandatory. It overlaps with Chapter IX: favorable penal laws are retroactive, and statutes on prescription of crimes are read for the accused. <i>Manila Lodge</i> is the anchor case.`,
	objectives: [
		'Define strict and liberal construction and state what each is not.',
		'Give the three factors that decide which approach applies.',
		'List the statutes read strictly and liberally, with the party each favors.',
		'Apply the penal-statute rule and its limits (<i>Purisima</i>).',
		'Distinguish tax impositions, tax exemptions and exceptions or provisos in tax laws.',
		'Distinguish grants of property from grants of power to LGUs, and both from local tax ordinances.',
		'Explain how <i>Manila Lodge</i> applied strict construction, and why Sec. 5 of the LGC did not help the petitioners in <i>Magtajas</i>.'

			term: 'Strict construction',
			plain: 'Read only what the words clearly say; add nothing by implication.',
			legal: 'Construction according to the letter of the statute, which recognizes nothing that is not expressed, takes the words in their exact meaning, and admits no equitable considerations; the statute\'s scope is not extended by implication, intendment or equity (§7.02).',
			why: 'Some laws take liberty, property or money, or give special advantages. Their reach should not grow beyond what the legislature clearly said.',
			example: 'A law punishing one who "assists a claimant" for an excessive fee does not reach a person who merely offered to help (§7.11, per your earlier guide).',
			confuse: 'The narrowest possible meaning. Strict construction gives words their fair, exact meaning; it does not shrink them below it.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Liberal construction',
			plain: 'Read the words generously to reach the law\'s purpose.',
			legal: 'Equitable construction that enlarges the letter of the statute to accomplish its intended purpose, carry out its intent, or promote justice; words get a fair and reasonable interpretation in light of the law\'s spirit (§§7.03–7.04).',
			why: 'Remedial and protective laws fail if read grudgingly.',
			example: 'Doubtful labor provisions are resolved in favor of labor (Art. 4, Labor Code).',
			confuse: 'Judicial legislation. Liberal construction cannot enlarge a clear provision or force words out of their natural meaning.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Nature–purpose–mischief test',
			plain: 'What kind of law is it, what is it for, and what problem does it fix?',
			legal: 'Whether a statute is strictly or liberally construed depends on its nature, the purpose to be served, and the mischief to be remedied (§7.01).',
			why: 'The same word may deserve a tight reading in a penal law and a generous one in a social-welfare law.',
			example: '"Employer" is read generously in a labor law protecting workers, but a law burdening "employers" does not include the State unless it is named (§7.22).',
			confuse: 'A mechanical list. The lists in Parts B and C are applications of this test, not a substitute for it.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Penal statute (strict against the State)',
			plain: 'If a criminal law is unclear, the doubt goes to the accused.',
			legal: 'Penal statutes are construed strictly against the State and liberally in favor of the accused; no person is brought within a penal law unless clearly within its terms, and no act is criminal unless the statute clearly makes it so (§7.07).',
			why: 'Fair notice: people must be able to know what conduct is forbidden. The purpose is not to let the guilty escape on technicalities.',
			example: 'An order lists one commodity in two classes with two ceiling prices; a seller who charges between them gets the benefit of the ambiguity (§7.11).',
			confuse: 'Statutes of limitation on crimes and amnesty proclamations, which also favor the accused but are <i>liberally</i> construed.'
		},
		{
			term: '<i>Mala in se</i> and <i>mala prohibita</i>',
			plain: 'Some acts are wrong in themselves; others are wrong only because a law forbids them.',
			legal: '<i>Mala in se</i> (felonies under the RPC) require criminal intent: <i>actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea</i>. In <i>mala prohibita</i> the question is only whether the law was violated; intent is generally not required unless the statute uses words like "willfully" or "knowingly" (§7.10).',
			why: 'Special laws often regulate conduct for public welfare where proof of intent would defeat enforcement.',
			example: 'Illegal possession of an unlicensed firearm (special law) vs. estafa (RPC).',
			confuse: 'Strict construction. Even a <i>malum prohibitum</i> law is strictly construed as to what acts it covers.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Statute in derogation of rights',
			plain: 'A law that cuts down rights people would otherwise have.',
			legal: 'Statutes that curtail common rights, usually under the police power, are strictly construed and confined to cases clearly within their scope or purpose (§7.13). Expropriation statutes are strictly construed against the expropriating authority (§7.14).',
			why: 'Rights should not be lost by implication.',
			example: 'Price-ceiling laws, laws suspending prescription, laws allowing the taking of private property.',
			confuse: 'Social legislation, which also regulates but is construed liberally in favor of the protected class.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Privilege',
			plain: 'A special favor granted by law, such as a franchise.',
			legal: 'Statutes granting privileges are strictly construed; one who claims a privilege must strictly comply with its conditions. <i>Privilegia recipiunt largam interpretationem voluntati consonam concedentis</i>: privileges are interpreted according to the will of the grantor (§7.15).',
			why: 'A privilege departs from equality before the law, so it extends only as far as the grantor clearly intended.',
			example: 'A franchise conditioned on starting operations within a fixed period is forfeited if the grantee fails to start on time.',
			confuse: 'A right. Rights are protected; privileges are confined to their terms.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Public grant to a local government unit',
			plain: 'When the State gives land or money to a city, read the gift narrowly.',
			legal: 'Legislative grants of property or money to political subdivisions are strictly construed against the grantee and in favor of the public (§7.16; <i>Manila Lodge</i>, citing Sutherland).',
			why: 'A public grant is a gratuitous transfer of public resources; anything not clearly given stays with the public.',
			example: '<i>Manila Lodge</i>: authority to lease or sell the north-end hotel site did not imply authority to sell the south end.',
			confuse: 'Grants of <b>powers</b> to LGUs, which are now liberally construed (LGC Sec. 5(a)).'
		},
		{
			term: '<i>Strictissimi juris</i> (tax exemptions)',
			plain: '"Of the strictest law." Whoever claims a tax exemption must point to clear words granting it.',
			legal: 'Tax exemptions are construed strictly against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority; taxation is the rule and exemption the exception; exemptions are never presumed, and the claimant must show a positive grant in the clearest language (§7.20).',
			why: 'Taxes are the lifeblood of government, and exemptions shift the burden to other taxpayers.',
			example: '<i>PLDT v. Province of Laguna</i> (2005): an "equality of treatment" clause did not clearly grant exemption from the local franchise tax.',
			confuse: 'Tax-imposing statutes, which are read strictly <i>against the government</i>.'
		},
		{
			term: 'General welfare clause',
			plain: 'The broad grant that lets local governments act for their people\'s well-being.',
			legal: 'The general welfare clause is liberally construed in favor of LGUs. It has two branches: ordinances necessary to carry out powers and duties conferred by law, and ordinances for health, safety, prosperity, morals, peace, good order, comfort and convenience (§7.27; LGC Sec. 16).',
			why: 'Local governments must respond to local needs without waiting for a specific grant for every problem.',
			example: 'A city ordinance requiring CCTV in 24-hour stores, absent any conflicting statute.',
			confuse: 'Power to defy a statute. An ordinance under the welfare clause is void if it contravenes a statute (<i>Magtajas</i>).'
		},
		{
			term: 'Social legislation and social justice',
			plain: 'Laws for workers, farmers and the poor are read in their favor when unclear.',
			legal: 'Laws implementing social justice and protection to labor are liberally construed, and doubts are resolved in favor of the persons the law intends to benefit (§§7.05, 7.26; Art. 4, Labor Code; Art. 1702, Civil Code). The social justice mandate binds all three branches.',
			why: 'The Constitution commits the State to social justice (Art. II, Sec. 10; Art. XIII).',
			example: 'Holiday pay: every employee not among those expressly excepted is entitled to it.',
			confuse: 'Automatic victory for the worker. A clear law is applied as written even if it does not favor labor.'
		},
		{
			term: 'Amnesty (and pardon)',
			plain: 'The State\'s forgiveness for crimes is read generously.',
			legal: 'Amnesty proclamations are liberally construed to carry out their purpose of encouraging the return of offenders to the fold of the law; doubts are resolved in favor of those claiming amnesty and against the State (§7.33). Statutes of limitation on crimes, being acts of grace, are likewise read in favor of the accused (§7.34).',
			why: 'They are acts of grace whose purpose would be defeated by a grudging reading.',
			example: 'If it is doubtful whether a rebel\'s act falls within the amnesty, resolve it for the rebel.',
			confuse: 'Penal statutes. Both favor the accused, but amnesty is read <i>liberally</i> while penal statutes are read <i>strictly</i>.'

	principles: [
		{
			name: 'The statute\'s nature, purpose and mischief decide the approach — and only for doubtful language',
			rule: 'Whether a statute is construed strictly or liberally depends on its nature, the purpose to be served and the mischief to be remedied. Either approach is used only when the language is doubtful; a clear and unambiguous statute is applied as written.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§7.01–7.04.',
			why: 'The approach is a tool for carrying out legislative intent, not a license to substitute the court\'s preference.',
			when: 'When a statutory term or provision is genuinely open to more than one reading.',
			limits: 'Liberal construction cannot enlarge a clear provision, force words out of their natural meaning, or engraft what the court thinks ought to be there: that would be judicial legislation. Strict construction does not mean the narrowest possible meaning.',
			differs: 'Chapter IV (verba legis) asks whether construction is needed at all; Chapter VII asks, once it is, how tightly to read.',
			example: '<i>Magtajas</i>: the LGC\'s liberal-construction clause did not help the city, because "gambling and other prohibited games of chance" was clear.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Penal statutes are construed strictly against the State and liberally for the accused',
			rule: 'No person is brought within a penal law unless clearly within its terms; no act is criminal unless the statute clearly makes it so. But strict construction is only one factor: it must not defeat the statute\'s evident intent, policy and purpose, and where the letter leads to absurdity the spirit controls.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§7.07–7.12; <i>People v. Purisima</i>, 86 SCRA 542 (1978).',
			why: 'Fair notice to the public of what is forbidden; liberty is not taken by implication.',
			when: 'A doubt about whether particular conduct, persons or penalties fall within a penal provision.',
			limits: 'If a penal law has two readings, one exempting the accused and one carrying out its manifest intent, the second is adopted (§7.12). Literal application that produces absurd results is rejected (<i>Purisima</i>: P.D. 9 read with its whereas clauses).',
			differs: 'Statutes on prescription of crimes and amnesty also favor the accused, but by <i>liberal</i> construction (§§7.33–7.34).',
			example: '<i>Purisima</i>: carrying a bladed weapon outside one\'s residence is punishable under P.D. 9 only when linked to subversion, rebellion, lawless violence, criminality or public disorder.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Statutes in derogation of rights and expropriation statutes are strictly construed',
			rule: 'Statutes curtailing common rights are confined to cases clearly within their scope. Statutes authorizing expropriation are construed strictly against the expropriating authority and liberally in favor of the property owner.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§7.13–7.14.',
			why: 'Rights and property should not be lost by implication or doubtful interpretation.',
			when: 'A law limits property rights, imposes price controls, suspends prescription, or authorizes taking private property.',
			limits: 'Strict construction does not invalidate a valid police-power measure; it only confines it to its clear scope.',
			differs: 'Social legislation also limits some rights (e.g., of employers) but is read liberally for its intended beneficiaries.',
			example: 'A law authorizing a city to expropriate land "for a public market" does not authorize taking land for a parking building leased to a private operator.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Privileges and legislative grants to local governments are strictly construed against the grantee',
			rule: 'One who claims a privilege must strictly comply with its conditions, and the privilege extends only as far as the grantor clearly intended. Legislative grants of public property or money to political subdivisions are strictly construed against the grantee.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§7.15–7.16; <i>Manila Lodge No. 761 v. CA</i> (1976), citing Sutherland.',
			why: 'A privilege or public grant gives an advantage at the public\'s expense; what is not clearly given remains with the public.',
			when: 'A franchise, a license, a land grant, or any statutory favor is claimed to extend beyond its express terms.',
			limits: 'The rule is about grants of property or privilege. Grants of governmental <i>powers</i> to LGUs are now construed liberally (§7.28; LGC Sec. 5(a)).',
			differs: 'Contrast §7.28: same LGU, opposite rule, depending on whether the question is property or power.',
			example: '<i>Manila Lodge</i>: Act No. 1360 authorized the City to lease or sell only the north-end hotel site; construed strictly, it gave no authority to sell the south end.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Removal of officials and naturalization laws are strictly construed',
			rule: 'Statutes on removal or suspension of public officials are strictly construed: the grounds are limited to those listed, and where a statute prescribes the procedure and the authority, other modes and authorities are excluded. Naturalization laws are strictly construed against the applicant; doubts are resolved against him.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§7.17–7.18.',
			why: 'Removal affects security of tenure; naturalization is a statutory privilege, not a natural right.',
			when: 'An official is disciplined on a ground or by an authority not clearly provided; an applicant\'s qualifications are doubtful.',
			limits: 'The removal rule does not bar removal on grounds the law clearly provides; it bars expansion by implication.',
			differs: 'Naturalization is strict against the claimant (like privileges and tax exemptions); removal statutes are strict in favor of the official.',
			example: 'If the law vests the power to investigate elective local officials in the provincial board, subject to appeal, the President cannot start the investigation directly (§7.17).'
		},
		{
			name: 'Tax laws: impositions strictly against the government; exemptions strictly against the claimant',
			rule: 'A tax cannot be imposed without clear and express words, and tax laws are not extended by implication. Tax exemptions are construed <i>strictissimi juris</i> against the taxpayer: exemptions are never presumed, and the claimant must show a positive grant in the clearest language.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§7.19–7.21; <i>PLDT v. Province of Laguna</i>, G.R. No. 151899, Aug. 16, 2005; <i>Maceda v. Macaraeg</i>, 197 SCRA 771 (1991); <i>CIR v. CA</i>, G.R. No. 107135, Feb. 23, 1999 (Cenvoco).',
			why: 'Taxation takes property, so its reach is not enlarged; but taxes are the lifeblood of government, so escapes from them are not enlarged either.',
			when: 'A dispute over whether a tax covers a person or transaction (imposition), or whether a claimed exemption exists (exemption).',
			limits: 'Qualifications (§7.21): a clear exemption is applied as written, without judicial additions; an exemption of a government instrumentality from "all forms of taxes" is construed broadly to cover direct and indirect taxes (<i>Maceda</i>); and exceptions or provisos in tax laws are strictly construed, which can favor the taxpayer (<i>CIR v. CA</i>).',
			differs: 'Imposition: doubt favors the taxpayer. Exemption: doubt favors the government.',
			example: '<i>CIR v. CA</i> (Cenvoco): the proviso barring credit for taxes on "raw materials or supplies used in the milling process" was strictly construed; containers and packaging are not raw materials, so the credit was allowed.'
		},
		{
			name: 'Statutes concerning the sovereign and suits against the government are strictly construed',
			rule: 'A statute that restricts rights or burdens the public treasury does not include the State, however broad its words, unless the State is expressly mentioned. The State\'s consent to be sued is strictly construed and does not extend to garnishment of public funds or execution on government property.',
			basis: 'Agpalo §§7.22–7.23.',
			why: 'Public funds and the sovereign\'s immunities are not given away by implication.',
			when: 'A general law is invoked against the government, or a judgment is enforced against public funds.',

<ul>
<li>Penal and tax-imposing laws are strict <b>for</b> the accused and the taxpayer; exemptions are strict <b>against</b> the claimant.</li>
<li>LGU powers are liberal (Sec. 5(a)); LGU property grants and tax ordinances are strict against the LGU (§7.16; Sec. 5(b)).</li>
