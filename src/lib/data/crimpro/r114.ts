	title: 'Bail',
	short: 'R114 Bail',
	tiu: 'pp. 115–135 (with RA 6036, RA 10389, PD 968 and A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC)',
	plain: `Bail is the security given so a person in custody can be released while his case goes on, guaranteeing that he will appear in court whenever required. Before conviction, bail is generally a right — the court can only set the amount. The big exception: offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment (formerly death), where bail is denied if the evidence of guilt is strong; to decide that, the court must hold a hearing in which the prosecution carries the burden. After an RTC conviction, bail becomes discretionary, and in some cases is forbidden. Bail can take four forms — surety bond, property bond, cash, or recognizance.`,
	purpose: `To reconcile the accused's interest in pre-trial liberty (honoring the presumption of innocence and letting him prepare his defense) with society's interest in assuring his presence at trial. Bail is not meant to punish, to raise revenue, or to prevent the accused from committing other crimes (Enrile v. Sandiganbayan, 2015, in Tiu).`,
	stage: `From the moment a person is in custody of the law — even before a case is filed (Sec. 17[c]) — through trial, and in some cases pending appeal; never after final judgment or once service of sentence has begun (Sec. 24), save for probation.`,
	questions: [
		'What is bail, and who may apply for it?',
		'When is bail a matter of right, a matter of discretion, not required, or not allowed?',
		'What hearing is required, and who bears the burden of proof?',
		'What are the forms of bail and their requirements?',
		'How is the amount fixed, increased or reduced?',
		'Where is bail filed?',
		'What happens when the accused fails to appear (forfeiture), and when is bail cancelled?',
		'What objections does applying for bail not waive?'
	],
	relations: `Bail follows arrest (${ruleLink('r113')}) or surrender, and may be sought even during preliminary investigation after inquest (${ruleLink('r112', 'sections', 'Rule 112, Sec. 6')}). Sec. 26 preserves objections to the arrest and to the absence of preliminary investigation if raised before plea (${ruleLink('r116')}). A bail condition makes unjustified absence a waiver of the right to be present, allowing trial in absentia (${ruleLink('r115')}). After conviction, bail pending appeal links to ${ruleLink('r120')} and Rule 122.`,
	principles: [
		'<b>Constitutional right</b> (Art. III, Sec. 13): all persons, except those charged with offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua when evidence of guilt is strong, are bailable before conviction; the right survives suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus; excessive bail is prohibited.',
		'<b>Custody is a prerequisite</b>: one must be under the custody of the law (arrested or surrendered) to apply.',
		'<b>The penalty prescribed, not imposable, controls</b> whether an offense is punishable by reclusion perpetua (People v. Valdez, 2015, in Tiu).',
		'<b>A hearing is mandatory</b> where bail is discretionary, even if the prosecution does not object (Serapio; Domingo v. Pagayatan).',
		'<b>Bail ends with the RTC judgment</b>: continued liberty on appeal on the same bail requires the bondsman\'s consent.'

		['"When is bail a matter of right?"', 'Under Sec. 4: before or after conviction by the first-level courts, and before conviction by the RTC of an offense not punishable by death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment. The court cannot deny it; it only fixes the amount.'],
		['"Your client is charged with murder. Is he entitled to bail?"', 'Murder is punishable by reclusion perpetua, so bail depends on whether the evidence of guilt is strong. He must petition for bail; the court must hold a summary hearing where the prosecution has the burden; if the evidence is not strong, bail is granted.'],
		['"He was convicted of homicide and sentenced to 12 years. Can he stay out?"', 'His bail ended at promulgation. Bail pending appeal is discretionary; because the penalty exceeds six years it must be denied if a bail-negating circumstance is shown. And because the conviction changed a non-bailable charge to a bailable one, only the appellate court can act on it.'],
		['"The accused skipped a hearing. What happens to the bond?"', 'The court declares the bail forfeited and gives the bondsmen 30 days to produce the accused and explain; otherwise judgment is rendered against them for the full amount, which cannot be reduced unless the accused is surrendered or acquitted.']
