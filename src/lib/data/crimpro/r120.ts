	plain: `The judgment is the court's final word: guilty or not guilty, and if guilty, the penalty and civil liability. It must be written by the judge, stating the facts and the law. A conviction must say what offense was committed, with what circumstances, the accused's participation and the penalty and damages; an acquittal must say whether guilt was not proved at all or only not beyond reasonable doubt, and whether the act did not exist (which decides the civil liability). The accused can be convicted only of what was charged or what is necessarily included in it. The judgment is read to the accused in person (promulgation); if he skips it without reason, he loses his remedies unless he surrenders within 15 days.`,
	purpose: `To end the case with a reasoned decision that the accused can understand and challenge, and to fix the consequences of conviction or acquittal, including civil liability.`,
	stage: `After the case is submitted for decision (${ruleLink('r119', 'sections', 'Rule 119, Sec. 11[d]')}); followed by remedies (new trial or reconsideration under Rule 121, appeal under Rule 122) and execution.`,
	questions: [
		'What is a judgment, and what are its formal requisites?',
		'What must a judgment of conviction and a judgment of acquittal contain?',
		'May the accused be convicted of several offenses in one information?',
		'When may he be convicted of an offense different from the one charged (variance)?',
		'How is a judgment promulgated, and what happens if the accused is absent?',
		'When does a judgment become final, and when may it be modified?'
	],
	relations: `The contents of an acquittal decide civil liability under ${ruleLink('r111')} (Sec. 2 — act did not exist vs. reasonable doubt). Variance (Secs. 4–5) protects the right to be informed (${ruleLink('r115')}) and depends on the information drafted under ${ruleLink('r110')}. Conviction for several offenses follows a waived duplicity objection (${ruleLink('r117')}). Promulgation in absentia parallels trial in absentia (${ruleLink('r115')}); bail after conviction links to ${ruleLink('r114', 'sections', 'Rule 114, Sec. 5')}.`,
	principles: [
		'<b>A judgment must state clearly and distinctly the facts and the law</b> (Const., Art. VIII, Sec. 14; Rule 120, Sec. 1).',
		'<b>Conviction only for the offense charged or one necessarily included</b> (Secs. 4–5).',
		'<b>An acquittal is final and unappealable</b> (save certiorari for grave abuse), but it must state its ground to fix civil liability.',
		'<b>Promulgation requires the accused\'s presence</b>, except for light offenses; unjustified absence forfeits remedies unless he surrenders and moves for leave within 15 days.',
		'<b>Appeal and probation are mutually exclusive</b> — subject to RA 10707\'s exception when the appellate court reduces the penalty to a probationable one.'

			text: `"Judgment is the adjudication by the court that the accused is guilty or not guilty of the offense charged and the imposition on him of the proper penalty and civil liability, if any. It must be written in the official language, personally and directly prepared by the judge and signed by him and shall contain clearly and distinctly a statement of the facts and the law upon which it is based."`,
			plain: `The judge writes and signs a decision, in the official language, explaining the facts and the law.`,
			reqs: `(1) Official language; (2) personally and directly prepared by the judge; (3) signed by him; (4) clear statement of facts and law.`,
			who: `The judge (he may have researchers, but must pen the decision — Tiu, citing Prof. Salvador).`,
			when: `Within three months from submission for lower courts (Const., Art. VIII, Sec. 15); 2017 Guidelines: promulgation within 90 days from submission (15 days for drug cases).`,
			effect: `A decision that fails to state facts and law leaves the parties unable to identify errors and violates due process (Lumanog v. People, in Tiu). A judge who did not hear the witnesses may still validly decide on the record (People v. Alfredo, in Tiu).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('lumanog', 'Lumanog v. People')}; <i>Merencillo v. People</i> (2007 — judgment vs. interlocutory order).`,
			hypo: `A judge issues a one-paragraph decision: "After evaluating the evidence, the court finds the accused guilty." It is defective for failing to state the facts and law.`,
			trap: `Illness, additional assignments, heavy caseload, a missing clerk of court and missing transcripts do not excuse delay; the judge should ask the SC for an extension (Tiu, p. 197).`

		{
			n: '2',
			title: 'Contents of the judgment',
			text: `If the judgment is of conviction, it shall state "(1) the legal qualification of the offense constituted by the acts committed by the accused and the aggravating or mitigating circumstances which attended its commission; (2) the participation of the accused in the offense, whether as principal, accomplice, or accessory after the fact; (3) the penalty imposed upon the accused; and (4) the civil liability or damages caused by his wrongful act or omission to be recovered from the accused by the offended party, if there is any, unless the enforcement of the civil liability by a separate civil action has been reserved or waived." If of acquittal, it shall state "whether the evidence of the prosecution absolutely failed to prove the guilt of the accused or merely failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In either case, the judgment shall determine if the act or omission from which the civil liability might arise did not exist."`,
			plain: `Conviction: name the crime and circumstances, the accused's role, the penalty, and damages. Acquittal: say whether the evidence failed completely or only fell short, and whether the act did not exist.`,
			reqs: `Conviction — four items. Acquittal — two determinations.`,
			effect: `The acquittal's statement determines whether civil liability ex delicto survives (Rule 111, Sec. 2; Civil Code Art. 29). An acquittal is immediately final; only certiorari for grave abuse lies.`,
			hypo: `An acquittal states: "The prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused misappropriated the funds." Civil liability may still be adjudged on preponderance of evidence.`,
			trap: `Omitting civil liability in a conviction is error unless it was reserved or waived (or filed separately first).`

			title: 'Judgment for two or more offenses',
			text: `"When two or more offenses are charged in a single complaint or information but the accused fails to object to it before trial, the court may convict him of as many offenses as are charged and proved, and impose on him the penalty for each offense, setting out separately the findings of fact and law in each offense."`,
			plain: `Duplicity not objected to → conviction for each offense charged and proved, with separate findings.`,
			reqs: `(1) Two or more offenses charged in one information; (2) no objection before trial (motion to quash for duplicity); (3) each offense proved; (4) separate findings.`,
			effect: `Waived duplicity is not a ground to set aside the conviction.`,
			hypo: `One information charges two counts of estafa on different dates; the accused never objects. Both are proved. Two convictions, two penalties, separate findings.`,
			trap: `Rule 120, Sec. 3 says "before trial," while Rule 117 requires the motion to quash before plea — answer that the objection must be raised by motion to quash before plea (Rule 117, Secs. 1 and 9).`

		{
			n: '4',
			title: 'Judgment in case of variance between allegation and proof',
			text: `"When there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint or information and that proved, and the offense as charged is included in or necessarily includes the offense proved, the accused shall be convicted of the offense proved which is included in the offense charged, or of the offense charged which is included in the offense proved."`,
			plain: `If the proof differs from the charge, convict of the lesser offense — whichever of the two is included in the other.`,
			effect: `Charged murder, proved homicide → homicide (included in the charge). Charged homicide, proved murder → homicide (the charge, which is included in the offense proved). The accused can never be convicted of the graver offense not charged.`,
			cases: `${caseLink('consulta', 'Consulta v. People (2009)')} (grave coercion included in robbery with intimidation); ${caseLink('corpus', 'Corpus v. People (2023)')} (no conviction for a lesser included offense that had prescribed when the information was filed).`,

And an offense charged is necessarily included in the offense proved, when the essential ingredients of the former constitute or form a part of those constituting the latter."`,
			plain: `"Includes": some elements of the charged offense make up the proved offense. "Included in": all the charged offense's elements are part of the proved offense.`,
			cases: `Tiu (p. 200): less serious physical injuries included in serious physical injuries; acts of lasciviousness in rape; theft in robbery; grave coercion in robbery with intimidation.`,
			hypo: `Charged: robbery with intimidation. Proved: the accused forced the victim to hand over a phone but intent to gain was not proved. Grave coercion (violence or intimidation compelling another to do something against his will) is included.`,
			trap: `The test is the elements <b>as alleged</b> in the information, not merely the elements in the abstract.`
		},
		{
			n: '6',
			title: 'Promulgation of judgment',
			text: `"The judgment is promulgated by reading it in the presence of the accused and any judge of the court in which it was rendered. However, if the conviction is for a light offense, the judgment may be pronounced in the presence of his counsel or representative. When the judge is absent or outside of the province or city, the judgment may be promulgated by the clerk of court." If the accused is confined in another province or city, the executive judge of the RTC there may promulgate on request, and that court may accept the notice of appeal and approve bail pending appeal — except that if the conviction changed the offense from non-bailable to bailable, bail can only be filed with and resolved by the appellate court. Notice is given to the accused personally or through his bondsman or warden and counsel; if he was tried in absentia because he jumped bail or escaped, at his last known address. If he fails to appear despite notice, promulgation is made by recording the judgment in the criminal docket and serving him a copy at his last known address or through counsel. If the judgment is of conviction and his absence was without justifiable cause, "he shall lose the remedies available in these rules against the judgment and the court shall order his arrest. Within fifteen (15) days from promulgation of judgment, however, the accused may surrender and file a motion for leave of court to avail of these remedies"; if he proves justifiable cause, he may avail of them within fifteen days from notice.`,
			plain: `The judgment is read in court with the accused present. Light offenses: counsel may stand in. If he skips promulgation without reason, it is recorded anyway, he loses his remedies and is arrested — unless within 15 days he surrenders and shows a good reason.`,
			reqs: `Notice to the accused (personally, or through bondsman/warden and counsel; last known address if he absconded); reading in his presence and that of any judge (or clerk if the judge is absent).`,
			who: `Judge or clerk of court; executive judge of the place of detention; accused; counsel; bondsman; warden.`,
			when: `Surrender and motion for leave within 15 days from promulgation; remedies within 15 days from notice of the order allowing them.`,
			exceptions: `Light offenses (counsel or representative). Death-penalty cases: automatic review was not forfeited by escape (People v. Taruc, 2009, in Tiu) — moot after RA 9346 as to death.`,
			effect: `Unjustified absence at promulgation of a conviction: loss of remedies (MR, new trial, appeal), arrest; the accused loses standing in court (Jaylo v. Sandiganbayan, 2015).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('jaylo', 'Jaylo v. Sandiganbayan (2015)')}; <i>People v. Taruc</i> (2009).`,
			hypo: `X, on bail, is notified of promulgation but goes to a fiesta. The judgment of conviction is recorded in the docket. Ten days later he surrenders and moves for leave, but cannot show a justifiable cause. He has lost his remedies.`,
			trap: `In criminal cases a judgment is "promulgated," not merely "served" by mail as in civil cases.`
		},
		{
			n: '7',
			title: 'Modification of judgment',
			text: `"A judgment of conviction may, upon motion of the accused, be modified or set aside before it becomes final or before appeal is perfected. Except where the death penalty is imposed, a judgment becomes final after the lapse of the period for perfecting an appeal, or when the sentence has been partially or totally satisfied or served, or when the accused has waived in writing his right to appeal, or has applied for probation."`,
			plain: `The accused may ask to modify or set aside a conviction before it becomes final or before his appeal is perfected. It becomes final when the appeal period lapses, sentence is (partly) served, he waives appeal in writing, or he applies for probation.`,
			reqs: `Motion of the accused; before finality or perfection of appeal.`,
			when: `Appeal period: 15 days from promulgation (Rule 122, Sec. 6).`,
			effect: `Only the accused may move to modify a conviction (to protect against double jeopardy). Applying for probation waives appeal (Almero v. People, 2014) — but see RA 10707.`,
			cases: `${caseLink('almero', 'Almero v. People (2014)')}; <i>Tamayo v. People</i> (2008 — a compromise after finality does not obliterate criminal liability).`,
			hypo: `Convicted of estafa, the accused applies for probation on day 10. The judgment becomes final; he can no longer appeal.`,
			trap: `The prosecution cannot move to increase the penalty after promulgation — that would place the accused twice in jeopardy.`,
			update: `RA 10707 (2015) amended the Probation Law: when a judgment imposing a non-probationable penalty is appealed and the appellate court modifies it to a probationable penalty, the accused may apply for probation based on the modified decision before it becomes final. Tiu (2017) states only the general rule from Almero.`,
			verify: `Check RA 10707, Sec. 4 for the exact procedure (where the application is filed).`

			n: '9',
			title: 'Existing provisions governing suspension of sentence, probation and parole not affected by this Rule',
			text: `"Nothing in this Rule shall affect any existing provisions in the laws governing suspension of sentence, probation or parole."`,
			plain: `Probation, parole and suspension of sentence (e.g., for children in conflict with the law) are governed by their own laws.`,
			hypo: `A minor offender\'s sentence may be suspended under the juvenile justice law notwithstanding Rule 120.`
