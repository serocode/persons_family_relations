	n: 112,
	title: 'Preliminary Investigation',
	short: 'R112 Preliminary Investigation',
	tiu: 'pp. 66–107 (including DOJ and Ombudsman rules, summary procedure and barangay conciliation)',
	plain: `Before a serious charge (penalty of at least 4 years, 2 months and 1 day) is filed in court, a prosecutor must first check whether there is enough basis to put the respondent on trial. That check is the preliminary investigation: the complainant files affidavits, the respondent answers with counter-affidavits, and the prosecutor decides whether there is probable cause. If yes, an information is filed in court, and the judge must then decide — independently — whether there is probable cause to issue a warrant of arrest. If the person was arrested without a warrant, a quicker summary review (inquest) replaces the preliminary investigation, though the arrested person can still ask for one.`,
	purpose: `To protect the innocent from hasty, malicious and oppressive prosecution and from the trouble, expense and anxiety of a public trial, and to protect the State from useless and expensive trials (DO 153, Part III, Sec. 2, in Tiu, p. 70).`,
	stage: `Between institution (${ruleLink('r110', 'sections', 'Rule 110, Sec. 1')}) and the filing of the information in court; then the judge's determination of probable cause for a warrant (Sec. 5) links to ${ruleLink('r113')} (arrest). Inquest (Sec. 6) follows a warrantless arrest.`,
	questions: [
		'What is a preliminary investigation, and when is it required?',
		'Who may conduct it?',
		'What is the step-by-step procedure, and what are the periods at each step?',
		'What happens after the investigating prosecutor resolves the case, and what remedies does the losing party have?',
		'What must the judge do when the information is filed, and when is no warrant needed?',
		'What happens when the respondent was arrested without a warrant (inquest)?',
		'What is the procedure for offenses that do not require preliminary investigation?',
		'What is the effect of the absence of a preliminary investigation, and how is it raised?'
	],
	relations: `Rule 112 follows ${ruleLink('r110')} (the complaint filed under Sec. 1 starts it) and leads to ${ruleLink('r113')} (warrants issued under Sec. 5; warrantless arrests that trigger inquest under Sec. 6) and ${ruleLink('r114')} (bail may be applied for even during a preliminary investigation after inquest; Rule 114, Sec. 26 preserves objections to the absence of preliminary investigation if raised before plea). A pending petition for review with the DOJ suspends arraignment (${ruleLink('r116')}, Sec. 11[c]). The absence of preliminary investigation is not a ground to quash (${ruleLink('r117')}).`,
	principles: [
		'<b>Preliminary investigation is statutory, not constitutional</b> — but where the law grants it, it is a substantive right and a component of due process (Tiu, p. 67).',
		'<b>It is waivable</b>: it must be invoked before or at the time of plea (Rule 114, Sec. 26; People v. Buluran, in Tiu).',
		'<b>It determines probable cause, not guilt</b>: "Is the respondent probably guilty and should he go to trial?"',
		'<b>Two determinations of probable cause</b>: executive (prosecutor — whether to file) and judicial (judge — whether to issue a warrant). Each is independent.',
		'<b>Once the information is filed, the court controls the case</b> (Crespo v. Mogul); a motion to withdraw requires the court\'s own assessment (Lanier v. People).',
		'<b>Absence of preliminary investigation does not affect jurisdiction</b> and is not a ground to quash; the remedy is to suspend proceedings and remand for investigation.'

			title: 'Preliminary investigation defined; when required',
			text: `"Preliminary investigation is an inquiry or proceeding to determine whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and the respondent is probably guilty thereof, and should be held for trial." Except as provided in the section on persons lawfully arrested without a warrant, a preliminary investigation is required before the filing of a complaint or information for an offense where the penalty prescribed by law is "at least four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day without regard to the fine."`,
			plain: `A preliminary investigation is a screening, not a trial. It is required when the penalty prescribed by law is at least 4 years, 2 months and 1 day — whatever the fine.`,
			reqs: `(1) An offense with a prescribed penalty of at least 4 years, 2 months and 1 day; (2) the respondent was not lawfully arrested without a warrant (otherwise inquest applies, Sec. 6).`,
			who: `Complainant; respondent; investigating officer.`,
			when: `Before the complaint or information is filed in court. The right must be invoked before or at plea.`,
			exceptions: `(1) Lawful warrantless arrest — inquest instead (Sec. 6). (2) Offenses below the threshold — Sec. 8 procedure. (3) Expedited Rules offenses — their own procedure.`,
			effect: `If required but not conducted: the information is not void and the court keeps jurisdiction; the accused may ask the court to suspend proceedings and remand for preliminary investigation — before plea. Failure to invoke it before plea waives it.`,
			cases: `${caseLink('larranaga', 'Larrañaga v. CA')} (remand, not dismissal); <i>Socrates v. Sandiganbayan</i> and <i>Enriquez v. Sarmiento</i> (absence of PI not a ground to quash and does not affect jurisdiction — Tiu, p. 77).`,
			hypo: `An information for estafa (penalty above 4 years, 2 months and 1 day) is filed without preliminary investigation. Before arraignment, the accused moves for preliminary investigation. The court should hold the proceedings in abeyance and order the prosecutor to conduct it — not dismiss the case.`,
			trap: `Measuring the threshold by the penalty that would actually be <b>imposed</b> (after modifying circumstances). The test is the penalty <b>prescribed by law</b>, "without regard to the fine."`,
			update: `DOJ Department Circular No. 015 (2024 DOJ-NPS Rules on Preliminary Investigations and Inquest Proceedings) applies the formal preliminary investigation to offenses with a prescribed penalty of at least six years and one day, and adopts a higher internal standard — "prima facie evidence with reasonable certainty of conviction." DOJ Department Circular No. 028 (2024) provides summary investigation (imprisonment of one day to one year, or fine) and expedited preliminary investigation (up to six years). These are executive rules for prosecutors; the Rules of Court threshold (4 years, 2 months and 1 day) and the probable-cause standard remain the answer to give on an exam unless your professor says otherwise.`,
			verify: `The cross-reference in Sec. 1 ("except as provided in section 7") was not renumbered when A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC (2005) deleted the old Sec. 5 on investigating judges; it refers to the warrantless-arrest section, now Sec. 6. Check your codal edition.`

Their authority includes all crimes cognizable by the proper court in their respective territorial jurisdictions (as amended by A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC, effective October 3, 2005).`,
			plain: `Prosecutors investigate. Judges no longer do (since 2005). Other bodies do when a law says so — chiefly the Ombudsman and the COMELEC.`,

			exceptions: `First-level court judges no longer conduct preliminary investigation (A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC).`,

			title: 'Procedure',
			text: `(a) The complaint states the respondent's address and is accompanied by the affidavits of the complainant and witnesses and supporting documents, in as many copies as there are respondents plus two; the affidavits are subscribed and sworn to before a prosecutor or government official authorized to administer oaths (or, if unavailable, a notary public), who certifies that he personally examined the affiants and is satisfied they voluntarily executed and understood their affidavits. (b) Within ten days after filing, the investigating officer either dismisses the complaint if he finds no ground to continue, or issues a subpoena with copies of the complaint and supporting documents; the respondent may examine and copy the complainant's evidence; objects need only be made available. (c) Within ten days from receipt of the subpoena, the respondent submits his counter-affidavit and those of his witnesses, sworn and certified the same way; "The respondent shall not be allowed to file a motion to dismiss in lieu of a counter-affidavit." (d) If the respondent cannot be subpoenaed, or does not submit counter-affidavits within ten days, the officer resolves the complaint on the complainant's evidence. (e) The officer may set a clarificatory hearing; the parties may attend but without the right to examine or cross-examine, though they may submit questions; it is held within ten days from submission (or expiration) of counter-affidavits and terminated within five days. (f) Within ten days after the investigation, the officer determines whether there is sufficient ground to hold the respondent for trial.`,
			plain: `Paper first: complaint with sworn affidavits; ten days for the prosecutor to dismiss or subpoena; ten days for the respondent to answer with sworn counter-affidavits (no motion to dismiss); an optional question-and-answer hearing with no cross-examination; then ten days to decide.`,
			reqs: `Complaint with respondent's address; sworn affidavits with the administering officer's certification; copies; subpoena with attachments; sworn counter-affidavits.`,
			who: `Complainant (any competent person for public crimes — Santos-Concio v. DOJ); respondent; investigating officer; administering officer or notary.`,
			when: `10 days (dismiss or subpoena) · 10 days (counter-affidavit) · hearing within 10 days, terminated within 5 · 10 days to resolve.`,
			exceptions: `(1) Reply and rejoinder affidavits are not provided for by Rule 112 but are allowed in practice (Tiu, citing Riano). (2) Ombudsman cases follow its own rules (A.O. No. 07), e.g., no motion to dismiss except for lack of jurisdiction. (3) DOJ rules set the prosecutors' internal procedure (DC 015, 2024).`,
			effect: `Non-submission of a counter-affidavit leads to resolution on the complainant's evidence; as long as efforts were made to reach the respondent, the investigation is valid (Ocampo v. Abando, 2014). Want of oath in the complaint is a defect of form only (Sasot v. People, 2005).`,

Abando (2014)')}; <i>Sasot v. People</i> (2005); <i>Artillero v. Casimiro</i> (2012 — failure to furnish the complainant a copy of the counter-affidavit is a procedural defect).`,
			hypo: `Respondent R receives a subpoena and files a "motion to dismiss" arguing the complaint states no offense. The prosecutor may disregard it: a motion to dismiss cannot take the place of a counter-affidavit. If R files nothing else within ten days, the complaint is resolved on the complainant's evidence.`,

			title: 'Resolution of investigating prosecutor and its review',
			text: `If the investigating prosecutor finds cause to hold the respondent for trial, he prepares the resolution and information and certifies under oath in the information that he (or an authorized officer) personally examined the complainant and his witnesses; that there is reasonable ground to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof; that the accused was informed of the complaint and the evidence against him; and that he was given an opportunity to submit controverting evidence. Otherwise, he recommends dismissal. Within five days from his resolution he forwards the record to the provincial or city prosecutor or chief state prosecutor (or the Ombudsman or deputy for Sandiganbayan cases), who acts within ten days and informs the parties. "No complaint or information may be filed or dismissed by an investigating prosecutor without the prior written authority or approval of the provincial or city prosecutor or chief state prosecutor or the Ombudsman or his deputy." If the head disapproves a recommendation to dismiss, he may file the information himself or direct another prosecutor to do so without another preliminary investigation. If the Secretary of Justice, on petition or motu proprio, reverses or modifies the resolution, he directs the prosecutor to file the information without another preliminary investigation or to dismiss or move to dismiss, with notice to the parties; the same rule applies to the Ombudsman.`,
			plain: `The investigating prosecutor only recommends. His boss approves within ten days. The Secretary of Justice can reverse on review. Nothing is filed or dismissed without the boss's written approval.`,
			reqs: `Resolution; information with the certification under oath; forwarding within 5 days; action by the head within 10 days; prior written approval.`,
			who: `Investigating prosecutor; head of office (provincial/city prosecutor, chief state prosecutor, Ombudsman or deputy); Secretary of Justice; parties.`,
			when: `Forward within 5 days; head acts within 10 days. DOJ appeal: petition for review within 15 days from receipt of the resolution (DC 70, 2000 NPS Rule on Appeal); one motion for reconsideration (DC 70: within 15 days; DO 153: within 10 days); MR of the Secretary's resolution within 10 days. Office of the President: only for offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua to death, new and material issues, within 30 days, prescription not lapsing within 6 months (MC 58).`,
			exceptions: `A petition for review is not given due course if the accused had already been arraigned when it was filed; arraignment after filing does not bar review (DC 70, Sec. 7). Petitions from resolutions in MTC-cognizable cases outside NCR go to the Regional State Prosecutor (DC 70-A).`,
			effect: `The certification is not an essential part of the information; its absence does not invalidate it (Alvizo v. Sandiganbayan, in Tiu). A pending petition for review does not bar the filing of the information, but the court proceedings should be held in abeyance; arraignment may be suspended for up to sixty days (Rule 116, Sec. 11[c]). The court is not bound by the Secretary's resolution (Crespo; Ledesma v. CA, 1997).`,

Talavera</i> (2005 — the prosecutor cannot reinvestigate to overrule the Secretary); ${caseLink('gatchalian', 'Gatchalian v. Ombudsman (2018)')}.`,
			hypo: `The city prosecutor approves the filing of an estafa information. Respondent files a petition for review with the DOJ and, in court, a motion to suspend arraignment. The court should suspend arraignment for up to 60 days; it may still issue a warrant of arrest (Viudez v. CA, 2009, in Tiu).`,
			trap: `Remedies differ by office: DOJ resolution → petition for review to the Secretary → Rule 65 to the CA (CTA for tax and tariff cases). Ombudsman resolution in a criminal case → Rule 65 directly to the Supreme Court (Gatchalian, 2018).`,
			update: `DOJ Department Circular No. 015 (2024) now governs NPS preliminary investigations; check whether its periods for motions for reconsideration and petitions for review replace those of DO 153 and DC 70 reproduced in Tiu.`,

He may immediately dismiss the case if the evidence on record clearly fails to establish probable cause. If he finds probable cause, he issues a warrant of arrest, or a commitment order if the accused has already been arrested under a warrant or the information was filed after inquest. In case of doubt, he may order the prosecutor to present additional evidence within five days from notice, and the issue must be resolved within thirty days from the filing of the complaint or information. (b) By the MTC: preliminary investigation of cases within the first-level courts' jurisdiction, when required, is conducted by the prosecutor; the warrant procedure follows paragraph (a).

If no inquest prosecutor is available, the complaint may be filed by the offended party or a peace officer directly with the proper court on the basis of the affidavit of the offended party or arresting officer or person. Before the complaint or information is filed, the person arrested may ask for a preliminary investigation, but he must sign a waiver of Art. 125 of the RPC in the presence of his counsel; notwithstanding the waiver, he may apply for bail, and the investigation must be terminated within fifteen days from its inception. After the filing in court without a preliminary investigation, the accused may, within five days from the time he learns of its filing, ask for a preliminary investigation with the same right to adduce evidence.`,
