	id: 'r113',
	n: 113,
	title: 'Arrest',
	short: 'R113 Arrest',
	tiu: 'pp. 108–114',
	plain: `An arrest is taking a person into custody so he can answer for a crime. Usually a judge issues a warrant first. Without a warrant, an arrest is lawful only in three situations: the person commits a crime in front of the arresting person; a crime has just been committed and the arresting person has personal knowledge of facts showing this person did it; or the person is an escaped prisoner. The Rule also says how arrests are made, who may be called to help, when a door may be forced, and who may visit the person arrested.`,
	purpose: `To secure the person of the accused so that he may be bound to answer for the offense, while protecting him from arbitrary seizure (Const., Art. III, Sec. 2).`,
	stage: `After the judge finds probable cause (${ruleLink('r112', 'sections', 'Rule 112, Sec. 5')}) — or, for warrantless arrests, before any case is filed, followed by inquest (${ruleLink('r112', 'sections', 'Rule 112, Sec. 6')}). Arrest is one way the court acquires jurisdiction over the person of the accused.`,
	questions: [
		'What is an arrest, and how is it made?',
		'How is a warrant executed, by whom, and within what periods?',
		'When may a peace officer or private person arrest without a warrant?',
		'What must the person arresting say, and when may he skip it?',
		'When may an officer break into or out of a building?',
		'What is the effect of an illegal arrest on the court\'s jurisdiction and on the evidence?',
		'What rights does the arrested person have to visits and counsel?'
	],
	relations: `Rule 113 follows ${ruleLink('r112')} (warrants issue under Sec. 5; warrantless arrests lead to inquest under Sec. 6) and connects to ${ruleLink('r114')} (bail; Sec. 23 allows warrantless re-arrest of an accused on bail who tries to leave the country; Sec. 26 preserves objections to the arrest if raised before plea), ${ruleLink('r115')} (custodial rights) and ${ruleLink('r117')} (lack of jurisdiction over the person, Sec. 3[c], is waived if not raised before plea).`,
	principles: [
		'<b>Warrant is the rule; warrantless arrest is the exception</b> — strictly construed.',
		'<b>No violence or unnecessary force</b>; no greater restraint than necessary (Sec. 2).',
		'<b>Personal knowledge</b> is the core of warrantless arrests: the overt act in the officer\'s presence (in flagrante) or personal knowledge of facts that a crime was just committed (hot pursuit).',
		'<b>An illegal arrest affects jurisdiction over the person</b>, but the objection is waived if not raised before plea — and waiver of the arrest does not waive the inadmissibility of evidence seized.',
		'<b>An illegal arrest is not a ground for acquittal</b> and does not set aside a conviction based on independent evidence.'

		{
			n: '1',
			title: 'Definition of arrest',
			text: `"Arrest is the taking of a person into custody in order that he may be bound to answer for the commission of an offense."`,
			plain: `Arrest = custody for the purpose of answering for a crime.`,
			effect: `Purpose matters: a motorist flagged down for a traffic violation and waiting for a ticket is not under arrest (Luz v. People, in Tiu).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('luz', 'Luz v. People (2012)')}.`,
			hypo: `A traffic enforcer stops a motorcycle rider for not wearing a helmet and asks for his license while writing a ticket. Not an arrest — no intent to take him into custody to answer for an offense.`,
			trap: `An "invitation" to the police station of a person suspected of a crime is treated as custodial investigation under RA 7438 (Sec. 2, last paragraph), so the rights of a person under custodial investigation attach.`
		},
		{
			n: '2',
			title: 'Arrest; how made',
			text: `"An arrest is made by an actual restraint of a person to be arrested, or by his submission to the custody of the person making the arrest. No violence or unnecessary force shall be used in making an arrest. The person arrested shall not be subject to a greater restraint than is necessary for his detention."`,
			plain: `Either physically restrain him or he submits. Use only the force needed.`,
			reqs: `(1) Intent to arrest; (2) actual restraint or submission under the belief that submission is necessary.`,
			effect: `Unnecessary force may give rise to criminal, civil (Civil Code Art. 32) and administrative liability.`,
			hypo: `A suspect, told he is under arrest, walks to the police car on his own. He has been arrested — by submission.`,
			trap: `Physical touching is not required.`
		},
		{
			n: '3',
			title: 'Duty of arresting officer',
			text: `The officer executing the warrant shall arrest the accused and deliver him to the nearest police station or jail without unnecessary delay.`,
			plain: `Arrest, then bring him to the nearest station or jail right away.`,
			who: `Officer executing the warrant.`,
			when: `Without unnecessary delay.`,
			effect: `Unnecessary delay may expose the officer to liability (e.g., RPC Art. 125 in warrantless cases; delay in delivery).`,
			hypo: `Officers arrest X on a warrant and drive around the city for six hours "to get information" before booking him. They violated Sec. 3.`
		},
		{
			n: '4',
			title: 'Execution of warrant',
			text: `"The head of the office to whom the warrant of arrest was delivered for execution shall cause the warrant to be executed within ten (10) days from its receipt. Within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period, the officer to whom it was assigned for execution shall make a report to the judge who issued the warrant. In case of his failure to execute the warrant, he shall state the reasons therefor."`,
			plain: `Ten days to serve; ten more days to report to the judge (with reasons if not served). The warrant does not expire after ten days.`,
			who: `Head of the law enforcement office; assigned officer; issuing judge.`,
			when: `Execute within 10 days from receipt; report within 10 days after that period.`,
			exceptions: `The 10-day period is for the officers\' compliance; the warrant remains valid until served or recalled (Tiu, p. 110).`,
			effect: `Non-service does not void the warrant. Under the 2017 Revised Guidelines, a case is archived if the accused remains at large for six months after delivery of the warrant to the proper peace officer.`,
			hypo: `A warrant is received by the police on January 5 and served on March 1. The arrest is valid; the 10-day period does not limit the warrant\'s life.`,
			trap: `Confusing it with a <b>search</b> warrant, which is valid only for 10 days from its date (Rule 126).`,
			update: `Rules on the Use of Body-Worn Cameras in the Execution of Warrants (A.M. No. 21-06-08-SC, 2021): officers executing arrest warrants use body-worn cameras and an alternative recording device, notify the person that he is being recorded, and submit recordings to the court. Per secondary summaries, failure to use them does not make an arrest unlawful or the evidence inadmissible, but may lead to contempt. OCA Circular No. 265-2023 reports an amendment requiring a report within 10 days from assignment when the warrant is not executed, and a duty of the issuing judge to check the Rule 113, Sec. 4 report.`,
			verify: `Body-worn camera provisions were confirmed only through summaries; read A.M. No. 21-06-08-SC before citing section numbers.`

		{
			n: '5',
			title: 'Arrest without warrant; when lawful',
			text: `A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person: "(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense; (b) When an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and (c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another." In (a) and (b), the person arrested shall be forthwith delivered to the nearest police station or jail and proceeded against under the inquest rule of Rule 112.`,
			plain: `Three exceptions: caught in the act (in flagrante), hot pursuit of a crime just committed with personal knowledge, and escapees. Add Rule 114, Sec. 23: an accused on bail who tries to leave the country.`,
			reqs: `In flagrante: (1) an overt act showing the person has just committed, is committing or is attempting a crime; (2) done in the presence or within the view of the arresting person (Valdez v. People). Hot pursuit: (1) an offense has just been committed; (2) probable cause based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person committed it (Pestilos v. Generoso).`,
			who: `Peace officers and private persons (citizen's arrest).`,
			when: `In flagrante: at the time of the overt act. Hot pursuit: immediately after the offense — immediacy is judged case by case (Tiu, citing People v. del Rosario; Go v. CA: six days later is not "just been committed").`,
			exceptions: `"Reliable information" from an informant alone, without an overt act in the officer's presence, does not justify an in flagrante arrest (People v. Molina; People v. Laguio, in Tiu). For continuing crimes (rebellion, subversion), Tiu notes an overt act was held unnecessary (Umil v. Ramos).`,
			effect: `Lawful arrest → inquest (Rule 112, Sec. 6). Unlawful arrest → the person is entitled to release; the court lacks jurisdiction over his person unless he waives the objection by not raising it before plea; evidence seized incident to the illegal arrest is inadmissible.`,
			cases: `${caseLink('pestilos', 'Pestilos v. Generoso (2014)')}; ${caseLink('go-ca', 'Go v. CA (1992)')}; ${caseLink('valdez', 'Valdez v. People (2007)')}; <i>People v. Laguio</i> (2007); <i>Umil v. Ramos</i>.`,
			hypo: `A robbery victim tells police, ten minutes after the robbery, that the robber wore a red shirt and ran toward the market. Police find a man in a red shirt, panting, holding the victim's distinctive bag. Valid hot-pursuit arrest: the offense had just been committed and the officers have personal knowledge of facts (the bag, the description, the timing).`,
			trap: `In flagrante requires the arresting officer to see the overt act; hot pursuit does not, but requires immediacy and personal knowledge of facts. Suspicious behavior alone (looking around, running away) is not an overt act (Valdez).`,
			update: `The last paragraph refers to "section 7 of Rule 112," which became Sec. 6 after the 2005 amendment.`
		},
		{
			n: '6',
			title: 'Time of making arrest',
			text: `"An arrest may be made on any day and at any time of the day or night."`,
			plain: `Any day, any hour.`,
			trap: `Contrast search warrants, which as a rule must be served in the day time unless the affidavit asserts that the property is on the person or in the place ordered to be searched (Rule 126, Sec. 9).`
		},
		{
			n: '7',
			title: 'Method of arrest by officer by virtue of warrant',
			text: `The officer shall inform the person to be arrested of the cause of the arrest and of the fact that a warrant has been issued, except when he flees or forcibly resists before the officer has the opportunity to so inform him, or when giving the information will imperil the arrest. "The officer need not have the warrant in his possession at the time of the arrest but after the arrest, if the person arrested so requires, the warrant shall be shown to him as soon as practicable."`,
			plain: `Tell him why and that there is a warrant — unless he runs, fights, or telling him would ruin the arrest. The warrant can be shown later on request.`,
			exceptions: `Flight; forcible resistance before the officer can inform; information would imperil the arrest.`,
			hypo: `An officer recognizes a wanted person at a mall and arrests him; the warrant is at the station. Valid; the warrant must be shown to him as soon as practicable if he asks.`
		},
		{
			n: '8',
			title: 'Method of arrest by officer without warrant',
			text: `When arresting without a warrant, the officer shall inform the person of his authority and the cause of the arrest, unless the person is engaged in the commission of an offense, is pursued immediately after its commission, has escaped, flees or forcibly resists before the officer can inform him, or when giving the information will imperil the arrest.`,
			plain: `State your authority and the cause, unless the exceptions apply.`,
			exceptions: `Engaged in the offense; pursued immediately after; escaped; flees or resists; information would imperil the arrest.`,
			hypo: `Police chase a fleeing snatcher and tackle him. No need to first state their authority — he is pursued immediately after the offense and is fleeing.`
		},
		{
			n: '9',
			title: 'Method of arrest by private person',
			text: `A private person making an arrest shall inform the person to be arrested of the intention to arrest him and the cause of the arrest, subject to the same exceptions as in Sec. 8.`,
			plain: `A citizen says "I am arresting you" and why — unless the exceptions apply.`,
			effect: `A private person who arrests outside Sec. 5 may be liable for illegal detention or unlawful arrest under the RPC.`,
			trap: `A private person states his "intention to arrest," not his "authority."`
		},
		{
			n: '10',
			title: 'Officer may summon assistance',
			text: `An officer making a lawful arrest may orally summon as many persons as he deems necessary; every person summoned shall assist when he can do so without detriment to himself.`,
			plain: `An officer can call bystanders to help; they must help if it is safe for them.`,
			hypo: `A lone officer arresting a large suspect asks two bystanders to hold the suspect's arms. They must assist if they can do so without danger to themselves.`
		},
		{
			n: '11',
			title: 'Right of officer to break into building or enclosure',
			text: `An officer, in order to make an arrest with a warrant or without a warrant under Sec. 5, may break into any building or enclosure where the person to be arrested is or is reasonably believed to be, "if he is refused admittance thereto, after announcing his authority and purpose."`,
			plain: `Knock and announce first; if refused, the officer may force entry.`,
			reqs: `(1) Lawful arrest (with or without warrant); (2) person is or is reasonably believed to be inside; (3) announcement of authority and purpose; (4) refusal of admittance.`,
			effect: `Forced entry without announcement and refusal makes the entry unlawful and may taint evidence obtained inside.`,
			hypo: `Officers with an arrest warrant knock, announce, and are refused. They break the door. Lawful.`,
			trap: `This authorizes entry to <b>arrest</b>, not a general search of the house. A search beyond the person and the area within his immediate control needs a search warrant (Rule 126).`
		},
		{
			n: '12',
			title: 'Right to break out from building or enclosure',
			text: `"Whenever an officer has entered the building or enclosure in accordance with the preceding section, he may break out therefrom when necessary to liberate himself."`,
			plain: `If trapped inside after a lawful entry, he may break out.`
		},
		{
			n: '13',
			title: 'Arrest after escape or rescue',
			text: `"If a person lawfully arrested escapes or is rescued, any person may immediately pursue or retake him without a warrant at any time and in any place within the Philippines."`,
			plain: `Anyone may immediately recapture a lawfully arrested person who escapes or is rescued — anywhere in the country.`,
			reqs: `(1) Prior lawful arrest; (2) escape or rescue; (3) immediate pursuit.`,
			hypo: `A suspect lawfully arrested breaks free and runs into a neighboring province; a barangay tanod catches him there. Valid.`
		},
		{
			n: '14',
			title: 'Right of attorney or relative to visit person arrested',
			text: `Any member of the Philippine Bar, at the request of the person arrested or another acting for him, may visit and confer privately with him in jail or any place of custody at any hour of the day or night; a relative may do the same, subject to reasonable regulations.`,
			plain: `Lawyers may visit any time; relatives may visit under reasonable rules. RA 7438 adds more.`,
			effect: `RA 7438: assistance of counsel at all times; information of rights in a language understood; custodial investigation report read and explained by counsel, otherwise void; extrajudicial confession in writing signed in the presence of counsel (or, upon valid waiver, of specified persons), otherwise inadmissible; Art. 125 waiver in writing with counsel; visits by immediate family, doctors, religious ministers and accredited NGOs; "invitation" is covered.`,
			hypo: `Police refuse to let the arrested person's lawyer see him at 2 a.m. "because it is late." Violation of Sec. 14 and RA 7438.`
