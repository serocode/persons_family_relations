/** Rule 115 — Rights of the Accused. One section with nine paragraphs, each discussed as its own "section". */
export const r115: RuleChapter = {
	id: 'r115',
	n: 115,
	title: 'Rights of the Accused',
	short: 'R115 Rights of the Accused',
	tiu: 'pp. 136–146',
	plain: `Rule 115 lists the nine rights every accused has at trial: to be presumed innocent; to know exactly what he is charged with; to be present and defended by a lawyer; to testify (or stay silent without it being held against him); not to be forced to incriminate himself; to face and cross-examine the witnesses against him; to compel witnesses and evidence in his favor; to a speedy, impartial and public trial; and to appeal. Most mirror the Bill of Rights. Some can be waived (presence at trial, the right to testify), some carry conditions (trial in absentia needs arraignment, notice and unjustified absence).`,
	purpose: `To implement Art. III, Secs. 14, 16 and 17 of the Constitution and make them operational in the trial court.`,
	stage: `"In all criminal prosecutions" — from arraignment to promulgation for presence and counsel; through trial for confrontation, compulsory process and speedy trial; and after judgment for appeal. The right to speedy disposition (Const., Art. III, Sec. 16) also reaches preliminary investigation.`,
	questions: [
		'What are the nine rights of the accused at trial?',
		'What does the presumption of innocence require, and how does it interact with the presumption of regularity?',
		'When may the accused be tried in absentia, and when must he be present?',
		'When must the court appoint counsel de officio?',
		'How does the right against self-incrimination differ for an accused and for an ordinary witness?',
		'When may testimony from another proceeding be used against the accused?',
		'How are the rights to speedy trial and speedy disposition violated, and what is the remedy?'
	],
	relations: `The right to be informed is implemented by ${ruleLink('r110')} (sufficiency of the information) and ${ruleLink('r116')} (arraignment and bill of particulars). Presence and trial in absentia connect to ${ruleLink('r114')} (bail conditions) and ${ruleLink('r120')} (promulgation in absentia). Compulsory process and conditional examination are in ${ruleLink('r119')} (Secs. 12–15). Speedy trial time limits and exclusions are in ${ruleLink('r116')} (Sec. 1[g]) and ${ruleLink('r119')} (Secs. 1–10).`,
	principles: [
		'<b>The accused\'s rights are personal</b> and, except where the Constitution or the Rules forbid, may be waived.',
		'<b>Presumption of innocence prevails over the presumption of regularity</b> in the performance of official duty (Tiu, p. 137).',
		'<b>Equipoise rule</b>: when the evidence is evenly balanced, the scales tilt toward the accused (People v. Erguiza, in Tiu).',
		'<b>Trial in absentia</b> requires arraignment, due notice and unjustified absence (Const., Art. III, Sec. 14[2]).',
		'<b>Speedy trial and speedy disposition are relative</b>: vexatious, capricious and oppressive delay, judged by length, reasons, assertion and prejudice.'

	sections: [
		{
			n: '1(a)',
			title: 'Presumption of innocence',
			text: `"To be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved beyond reasonable doubt."`,
			plain: `The State must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt; the accused does not have to prove innocence.`,
			reqs: `Proof beyond reasonable doubt of every element and of identity.`,
			who: `Every accused; the prosecution bears the burden.`,
			effect: `Where circumstances yield two inferences, one consistent with innocence, the inference of innocence prevails; evenly balanced evidence results in acquittal (equipoise rule — People v. Erguiza, in Tiu). The presumption of regularity of official acts cannot prevail over it.`,
			cases: `<i>People v. Erguiza</i> (equipoise rule, in Tiu).`,
			hypo: `In a buy-bust case, the only proof of the chain of custody is the officers' testimony with unexplained gaps. The court cannot fill the gaps with the presumption of regularity; the presumption of innocence controls.`,
			trap: `The presumption arises when a person is charged — i.e., an accused. It does not mean the accused may stay silent and win automatically; once the prosecution makes a prima facie case, the burden of evidence shifts.`
		},
		{
			n: '1(b)',
			title: 'Right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation',
			text: `"To be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him."`,
			plain: `He must know exactly what he is accused of — through a sufficient information read to him in a language he understands.`,
			reqs: `A sufficient information (Rule 110, Secs. 6–12); arraignment in a known language or dialect (Rule 116, Sec. 1).`,
			effect: `Conviction for an offense not charged or not necessarily included violates the right (Rule 120, Sec. 4). Missing averments may be cured when the complaint or the prosecutor's resolution containing them is attached to the information and forms part of the record (Olivarez v. People, 2005 — rule on substantial compliance, in Tiu).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('olivarez', 'Olivarez v. People (2005)')}; ${caseLink('solar', 'People v. Solar (2019)')}.`,
			hypo: `An information for acts of lasciviousness omits the victim's minority, but the prosecutor's resolution attached to it states her age. Under Olivarez, the accused cannot claim he was not informed — subject to the waiver rule in Solar for defectively stated qualifying circumstances.`,
			trap: `The remedy for a vague information is a motion for bill of particulars or to quash before plea; waiting until after conviction usually fails.`
		},
		{
			n: '1(c)',
			title: 'Right to be present and to defend in person and by counsel; trial in absentia',
			text: `"To be present and defend in person and by counsel at every stage of the proceedings, from arraignment to promulgation of the judgment." The accused may waive his presence at the trial pursuant to the stipulations in his bail, unless his presence is specifically ordered for identification. "The absence of the accused without justifiable cause at the trial of which he had notice shall be considered a waiver of his right to be present thereat." When an accused under custody escapes, he waives his presence "on all subsequent trial dates until custody over him is regained." Upon motion, he may defend himself in person when it sufficiently appears that he can properly protect his rights without counsel.`,
			plain: `He may attend every stage and must be defended by a lawyer. If he skips trial without reason after notice, or escapes, the trial goes on without him. He may represent himself only if the court is satisfied he can.`,
			reqs: `Trial in absentia: (1) arraignment; (2) due notice; (3) unjustified absence (Const., Art. III, Sec. 14[2]).`,
			who: `Accused; counsel de parte or de officio; court.`,
			when: `From arraignment to promulgation.`,
			exceptions: `Presence is required (1) at arraignment and plea; (2) during trial when ordered for identification; (3) at promulgation, except for light offenses, where he may appear through counsel or a representative (Tiu, citing People v. de Grano).`,
			effect: `Absence before arraignment: the case cannot proceed (no trial in absentia without arraignment). Absence on a trial day: waiver for that day. Escape after arraignment: waiver for all subsequent dates. Absence at promulgation without justification: promulgation in absentia and loss of remedies unless he surrenders and moves for leave within 15 days (Rule 120, Sec. 6).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('libuit', 'Libuit v. People (2005)')}; <i>Tamayo v. People</i> (2008) and <i>Andrada v. People</i> (2005) on negligence of counsel (in Tiu).`,
			hypo: `After arraignment, X jumps bail. The prosecution presents its evidence over three months; X is tried and convicted in absentia. Valid: arraigned, notified (through the address in his bail), unjustified absence.`,
			trap: `Counsel de officio is <b>mandatory at arraignment</b>; during trial, the court has no duty to appoint one if the accused proceeded with counsel of his choice who later fails to appear (Libuit). But under the 2017 Guidelines, if counsel de parte is absent the hearing proceeds with a counsel de officio appointed by the court.`,
			update: `2017 Revised Guidelines, III.13(b): "In the absence of the counsel de parte, the hearing shall proceed upon appointment by the court of a counsel de officio." III.3: if a party does not qualify for PAO, the IBP local chapter provides free legal assistance.`

		{
			n: '1(d)',
			title: 'Right to testify as a witness in his own behalf',
			text: `"To testify as a witness in his own behalf but subject to cross-examination on matters covered by direct examination. His silence shall not in any manner prejudice him."`,
			plain: `He may testify, but then he can be cross-examined on what he said. If he chooses silence, it cannot be held against him.`,
			effect: `Cross-examination is limited to matters covered by direct examination (and matters connected with them). No adverse inference from silence.`,
			hypo: `The accused testifies only on his alibi. On cross, the prosecutor asks about an unrelated robbery. Objection — beyond the scope and, as to a different offense, protected by the right against self-incrimination (Ayson).`,
			trap: `The prosecutor may not comment on the accused's failure to testify as evidence of guilt.`
		},
		{
			n: '1(e)',
			title: 'Right against self-incrimination',
			text: `"To be exempt from being compelled to be a witness against himself."`,
			plain: `He cannot be forced to give testimonial evidence against himself. He can refuse to take the stand at all.`,
			reqs: `Compulsion; testimonial (or communicative) evidence — oral testimony, or acts requiring the use of intelligence and attention (e.g., creating a handwriting sample — Beltran v. Samson).`,
			who: `Natural persons only (it is personal); applies in all proceedings, but its scope differs: an accused may refuse to testify altogether, an ordinary witness may only refuse particular incriminating questions (People v. Ayson).`,
			exceptions: `Purely mechanical acts or physical evidence (e.g., fingerprinting, being photographed) are not covered. The right is waivable — by testifying or by failing to object.`,
			effect: `If he testifies, he may be cross-examined on matters on direct and connected matters; but he may refuse to answer a question that would incriminate him for a <b>different</b> offense (Ayson).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('ayson', 'People v. Ayson (1989)')}; <i>Beltran v. Samson</i> (handwriting).`,
			hypo: `In a falsification case, the court orders the accused to write a passage so the prosecution can compare his handwriting. He may refuse: writing requires intelligence and attention and creates evidence that did not exist (Beltran v. Samson).`,
			trap: `Custodial-investigation rights (Art. III, Sec. 12) are distinct: they protect a person under investigation before the case is filed; Rule 115(e) protects the accused at trial.`
		},
		{
			n: '1(f)',
			title: 'Right to confront and cross-examine witnesses',
			text: `"To confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him at the trial." Either party may use the testimony of a witness who is deceased, out of or cannot with due diligence be found in the Philippines, unavailable or otherwise unable to testify, given in another case or proceeding, judicial or administrative, involving the same parties and subject matter, the adverse party having had the opportunity to cross-examine him.`,
			plain: `Witnesses against him must testify in his presence and be open to cross-examination. Testimony from an earlier case may be used only if the witness is now unavailable, the parties and subject matter are the same, and there was an opportunity to cross-examine.`,
			reqs: `Former testimony: (1) witness deceased, abroad or not found, unavailable or unable; (2) same parties and subject matter; (3) adverse party had the opportunity to cross-examine (Tiu, p. 141).`,
			effect: `Testimony not subjected to cross-examination through no fault of the accused may be stricken. Opportunity to cross-examine, not actual cross-examination, is enough.`,
			cases: `Rule 130, Sec. 47 (testimony or deposition at a former proceeding), reproduced in Tiu; Prof. Salvador's view (Tiu) that depositions in another proceeding cannot be used in a criminal case because Rule 115(f) does not mention depositions.`,
			hypo: `The victim testified on direct in the criminal case but died before cross-examination. Her direct testimony may be stricken unless the delay in cross-examination was due to the defense.`,
			trap: `"Opportunity" is the test: a party who could have cross-examined but did not cannot complain.`,
			update: `The Revised Rules on Evidence (A.M. No. 19-08-15-SC, effective May 1, 2020) renumbered several provisions; check the current section number of the former-testimony rule before citing "Rule 130, Sec. 47."`,
			verify: `Section number under the 2019 amendments not confirmed.`
		},
		{
			n: '1(g)',
			title: 'Right to compulsory process',
			text: `"To have compulsory process issued to secure the attendance of witnesses and production of other evidence in his behalf."`,
			plain: `He can make the court subpoena his witnesses and documents.`,
			reqs: `Request for subpoena ad testificandum or duces tecum; conditional examination of defense witnesses when they are sick, infirm, more than 100 km away without means, or otherwise unavailable (Rule 119, Secs. 12–13).`,
			effect: `Denial of compulsory process for material evidence may violate due process.`,
			hypo: `A defense witness lives in a remote island more than 100 km away and cannot afford to travel. The accused may move for conditional examination (Rule 119, Sec. 12) before any judge, or a member of the Bar designated by the judge.`,
			trap: `Conditional examination of a <b>prosecution</b> witness may be done only before the court where the case is pending (Rule 119, Sec. 15); for a <b>defense</b> witness, before any judge or a designated lawyer (Sec. 13).`
		},
		{
			n: '1(h)',
			title: 'Right to speedy, impartial and public trial',
			text: `"To have speedy, impartial and public trial."`,
			plain: `No unreasonable delay; a neutral judge; proceedings open to the public.`,
			reqs: `Time limits: arraignment within 30 days from the court's acquisition of jurisdiction (Rule 116, Sec. 1[g]); trial within 30 days from receipt of the pre-trial order (Rule 119, Sec. 1); trial completed within 180 days from the first day (Rule 119, Sec. 2) — minus excluded delays (Rule 119, Sec. 3). For detained accused: A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC time limits.`,
			who: `Only the accused in a criminal case may invoke the right to speedy trial (Tiu, p. 143).`,
			exceptions: `Excluded delays (Rule 119, Sec. 3). Exclusion of the public is allowed when the evidence is offensive to decency or public morals, or on the accused's motion (Rule 119, Sec. 21).`,
			effect: `Remedy: motion to dismiss before trial (Rule 119, Sec. 9); failure to move before trial waives it. Dismissal for violation of speedy trial is equivalent to an acquittal and bars reprosecution even though the accused moved for it (Tiu, citing Condrada v. People).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('perez-people', 'Perez v. People (2008)')}; <i>Andres v. Cacdac</i> (the accused should first ask for trial, then move to dismiss if the prosecution cannot proceed); <i>Mari v. Gonzales</i> (balancing factors) — all in Tiu.`,
			hypo: `The prosecution fails to present any witness for eight consecutive settings over a year, each time asking for postponement. The accused objects and asks for trial each time; after the eighth, he moves to dismiss. Dismissal is warranted and bars a new prosecution.`,
			trap: `Speedy trial is a <b>relative</b> concept; exceeding the numerical limits is not automatically a violation if the delay is excluded or justified (Domondon; Olbes v. Buemio, in Tiu).`,
			update: `2017 Revised Guidelines for Continuous Trial: postponements prohibited except for acts of God, force majeure or physical inability of a witness; one-day examination rule; strict periods.`
		},
		{
			n: '1(i)',
			title: 'Right to appeal',
			text: `"To appeal in all cases allowed and in the manner prescribed by law."`,
			plain: `He may appeal when the law allows, following the procedure (Rules 122–125).`,
			effect: `The right to appeal is statutory; it is lost by escape or jumping bail during appeal, and by unjustified absence at promulgation unless he surrenders and moves for leave within 15 days (Rule 120, Sec. 6).`,
			hypo: `An accused convicted in absentia who does not surrender within 15 days loses the right to appeal.`,
			trap: `Appeal is a statutory, not a natural, right — but once granted by law, it is part of due process.`

				legalBasis: 'Rule 115, Sec. 1(c) (counsel; counsel de officio mandatory at arraignment); 2017 Guidelines, III.13(b) (proceed with counsel de officio when counsel de parte is absent); Sec. 1(f) (former testimony: witness abroad or not found, same parties and subject matter, opportunity to cross); Sec. 1(d) ("his silence shall not in any manner prejudice him").',
				application: 'Counsel de officio at arraignment satisfies the right. Proceeding with PAO counsel during one hearing is allowed under the 2017 Guidelines. The civil case involved the same parties and subject matter; the witness is abroad and cannot be found; if Z (as a party) had the opportunity to cross-examine, the testimony may be used. The judge drew an adverse inference from silence.',
				conclusion: 'The judgment is vulnerable on the adverse-inference ground; if the conviction rests on that inference, it should be reversed.'
