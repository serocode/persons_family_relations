	n: 116,
	title: 'Arraignment and Plea',
	short: 'R116 Arraignment and Plea',
	tiu: 'pp. 147–157',
	plain: `Arraignment is the moment the accused is formally told, in open court and in a language he understands, exactly what he is charged with, and asked: guilty or not guilty? It is required by due process; without it there can be no valid trial, no trial in absentia, and no double jeopardy. Before he pleads, the accused must be given a lawyer and may ask for clarifications (bill of particulars), ask to see the prosecution's evidence, or ask the court to suspend the arraignment. Once he pleads, most objections to the information and to the preliminary investigation are waived. He may plead guilty to a lesser offense (plea bargaining) if the prosecutor and offended party agree and the court approves.`,
	purpose: `To implement the constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation and to fix the issues for trial.`,
	stage: `After the information is filed and the court acquires jurisdiction over the person (arrest or surrender); before pre-trial (${ruleLink('r118')}) and trial (${ruleLink('r119')}). Arraignment is the cut-off for motions to quash (${ruleLink('r117')}), bills of particulars, and objections to the arrest and preliminary investigation (${ruleLink('r114', 'sections', 'Rule 114, Sec. 26')}).`,
	questions: [
		'How, where and when is the accused arraigned?',
		'What must the court do about counsel before arraignment?',
		'What pleas may be entered, and when is a plea of not guilty entered for the accused?',
		'When may the accused plead guilty to a lesser offense, and with whose consent?',
		'What must the court do when the accused pleads guilty to a capital offense? To a non-capital offense?',
		'When may an improvident plea be withdrawn?',
		'What remedies does the accused have before arraignment (bill of particulars, discovery, suspension)?'
	],
	relations: `Rule 116 implements ${ruleLink('r115')} (right to be informed; right to counsel) and is the gateway to ${ruleLink('r117')} (motion to quash must be filed before plea) and ${ruleLink('r118')} (pre-trial follows arraignment). A pending petition for review under ${ruleLink('r112', 'sections', 'Rule 112, Sec. 4')} and a prejudicial question under ${ruleLink('r111')} suspend arraignment. Arraignment is a requisite of double jeopardy (${ruleLink('r117', 'sections', 'Rule 117, Sec. 7')}) and of trial in absentia (${ruleLink('r115')}).`,
	principles: [
		'<b>Arraignment is indispensable</b> to due process; proceedings without it are void unless the defect is cured by the accused\'s participation without objection (People v. Pangilinan, 2007).',
		'<b>The accused must be present and plead personally.</b>',
		'<b>Plea is the cut-off</b>: defects in the information (other than the non-waivable grounds), the arrest and the preliminary investigation are waived by pleading.',
		'<b>Plea bargaining is a rule of procedure</b> within the Supreme Court\'s rule-making power (Estipona v. Lobrigo, 2017); it is not a right of the accused and requires consent and court approval.',
		'<b>A plea of guilty to a capital offense never dispenses with evidence</b>: searching inquiry plus proof of guilt and degree of culpability.'

			title: 'Arraignment and plea; how made',
			text: `(a) The accused must be arraigned before the court where the complaint or information was filed or assigned for trial, in open court, by the judge or clerk, by furnishing him a copy of the complaint or information, reading it in the language or dialect known to him, and asking him whether he pleads guilty or not guilty; the prosecution may call witnesses other than those named. (b) "The accused must be present at the arraignment and must personally enter his plea." Both arraignment and plea shall be made of record, but failure to do so does not affect validity. (c) If he refuses to plead or makes a conditional plea, a plea of not guilty is entered. (d) If he pleads guilty but presents exculpatory evidence, his plea is deemed withdrawn and a plea of not guilty entered. (e) For an accused under preventive detention: raffle and transmittal within 3 days from filing; arraignment within 10 days from raffle; pre-trial within 10 days after arraignment. (f) The private offended party shall appear at arraignment for plea bargaining, civil liability and other matters; if he fails to appear despite notice, the court may allow a plea of guilty to a lesser included offense with the conformity of the trial prosecutor alone. (g) Unless a shorter period is provided, arraignment shall be held within 30 days from the date the court acquires jurisdiction over the person of the accused, excluding the pendency of a motion to quash, a bill of particulars or other causes justifying suspension.`,
			plain: `In open court: give him a copy, read it in his language, ask for his plea. He must be there and answer himself. Refusal or a conditional plea = "not guilty." Pleading guilty but explaining away guilt = "not guilty." Detained accused: 3 days to raffle, 10 to arraign, 10 to pre-trial. Others: arraign within 30 days.`,
			reqs: `(1) Proper court; (2) open court; (3) judge or clerk; (4) copy furnished; (5) read in a known language or dialect; (6) asked to plead; (7) personal presence and personal plea.`,
			who: `Judge or clerk; accused (personally); counsel; prosecutor; private offended party.`,
			when: `Detained accused: raffle 3 days; arraignment 10 days from raffle; pre-trial 10 days after. Others: within 30 days from acquisition of jurisdiction over the person (2017 Guidelines: arraignment and pre-trial within 10 calendar days from the court's receipt of the case for detained accused, 30 days for others).`,
			exceptions: `Excluded from the 30 days: pendency of a motion to quash, bill of particulars, or other grounds for suspension. In multiple cases, the reading of the information may be waived with the accused's informed consent (2017 Guidelines, III.8[c]).`,
			effect: `Without arraignment: proceedings are void, no double jeopardy, no trial in absentia (Tiu, citing Taglay v. Daray, 2012). A belated arraignment is cured if the accused participated in trial without objection (People v. Pangilinan, 2007). Under RA 8493, Sec. 7, the accused pleading not guilty states whether his defense is negative or affirmative; an affirmative defense may modify the order of trial.`,
			cases: `${caseLink('pangilinan-2007', 'People v. Pangilinan (2007)')}; <i>People v. Magat</i> (plea conditioned on a lighter penalty is conditional — not guilty entered) and <i>People v. Comendador</i> (plea for leniency is not conditional) — in Tiu.`,
			hypo: `At arraignment, X says, "Guilty, but only if I get probation." That is a conditional plea; the court must enter a plea of not guilty.`,
			trap: `A plea of guilty followed by a claim of self-defense is not a plea of guilty — it is deemed withdrawn and not guilty is entered (Sec. 1[d]).`,
			update: `2017 Revised Guidelines (A.M. No. 15-06-10-SC), III.8: arraignment and pre-trial set within 10 calendar days from the court's receipt of the case for detained accused and within 30 calendar days from acquisition of jurisdiction for others; notice to the private complainant or arresting officer; waiver of reading in multiple cases; plea bargaining proceeds immediately at arraignment if the offended party (private crimes) or arresting officer (victimless crimes) is present to consent with the prosecutor's conformity.`

			title: 'Plea of guilty to a lesser offense',
			text: `"At arraignment, the accused, with the consent of the offended party and the prosecutor, may be allowed by the trial court to plead guilty to a lesser offense which is necessarily included in the offense charged. After arraignment but before trial, the accused may still be allowed to plead guilty to said lesser offense after withdrawing his plea of not guilty. No amendment of the complaint or information is necessary."`,
			plain: `Plea bargaining: with the prosecutor's and victim's consent and the court's approval, plead guilty to a lesser included offense — at arraignment, or later before trial after withdrawing the not-guilty plea.`,
			reqs: `(1) Lesser offense necessarily included in the offense charged; (2) consent of the offended party (dispensed with if he fails to appear despite notice — Sec. 1[f]) and of the prosecutor; (3) court approval; (4) at arraignment, or after arraignment but before trial.`,
			who: `Accused; prosecutor; offended party; court.`,
			when: `At arraignment, or after arraignment but before trial (in practice, at pre-trial — Rule 118, Sec. 1[a]).`,
			exceptions: `Drug cases: governed by the Supreme Court's plea bargaining framework (A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC, as revised); after Montierro (2022), courts may overrule a prosecution objection based solely on DOJ guidelines inconsistent with the framework, but shall not allow plea bargaining if the objection is valid and supported by evidence (e.g., evidence of guilt is strong, or the accused is a recidivist or habitual offender).`,
			effect: `Conviction for the lesser offense; no amendment of the information needed. A plea to a lesser offense is not the mitigating circumstance of voluntary plea of guilt (which requires a plea to the offense charged — Tiu, citing Prof. Salvador).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('estipona', 'Estipona v. Lobrigo (2017)')}; ${caseLink('montierro', 'People v. Montierro (2022)')}; <i>Daan v. Sandiganbayan</i> (definition; addressed to the court\'s discretion — in Tiu).`,
			hypo: `Charged with homicide, Y offers at pre-trial to plead guilty to reckless imprudence resulting in homicide. Reckless imprudence is not "necessarily included" in intentional homicide in the technical sense — check whether the lesser offense's elements are included in those alleged. If they are not, the plea cannot be accepted without amending the information.`,
			trap: `The offended party's consent is required in all cases at arraignment — not just in private crimes — unless he fails to appear despite notice.`,
			update: `Tiu reproduces the 2017 Guidelines' "Plea Bargaining Except in Drug Cases" and RA 9165, Sec. 23. Estipona v. Lobrigo (G.R. No. 226679, August 15, 2017, En Banc) declared Sec. 23 unconstitutional for encroaching on the Court's rule-making power; the Court then adopted a plea bargaining framework for drug cases (A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC, 2018), revised and applied in People v. Montierro (G.R. No. 254564, July 26, 2022, En Banc).`,

			text: `"When the accused pleads guilty to a capital offense, the court shall conduct a searching inquiry into the voluntariness and full comprehension of the consequences of his plea and require the prosecution to prove his guilt and the precise degree of culpability. The accused may present evidence in his behalf."`,
			plain: `If he pleads guilty to a capital offense, the court must (1) question him carefully to be sure he understands and means it, (2) still make the prosecution prove guilt and degree of culpability, and (3) let him present evidence.`,
			reqs: `(1) Searching inquiry; (2) prosecution proves guilt and precise degree of culpability; (3) opportunity for the accused to present evidence (waivable).`,
			who: `Court; prosecution; accused.`,
			effect: `Failure to conduct a searching inquiry renders the plea improvident and inefficacious (People v. Gumimba, in Tiu). A conviction resting solely on an improvident plea is set aside and the case remanded; one supported by independent evidence stands (People v. Documento, 2010; People v. Gambao, 2013).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('pastor', 'People v. Pastor (2002)')} (guidelines for the searching inquiry); ${caseLink('documento', 'People v. Documento (2010)')}; <i>People v. Francisco</i> (2010 — evidence to determine participation and modifying circumstances; the accused may waive presenting evidence).`,
			hypo: `The accused pleads guilty to qualified rape. The judge asks only, "Do you understand your plea?" and convicts without evidence. The plea is improvident; the conviction rests solely on it, so the case is remanded.`,
			trap: `Since RA 9346 (2006) bars the death penalty, courts still apply Sec. 3's safeguards to offenses that were "capital" — in practice, to grave offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua; check how your professor treats this.`,
			update: `RA 9346 prohibits the imposition of the death penalty; Tiu notes the substitution of reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment (RA 9346, Sec. 2).`,

			title: 'Plea of guilty to non-capital offense; reception of evidence, discretionary',
			text: `"When the accused pleads guilty to a non-capital offense, the court may receive evidence from the parties to determine the penalty to be imposed."`,
			plain: `For non-capital offenses, the court may (but need not) hear evidence — to fix the penalty.`,
			effect: `Discretionary, not mandatory; the accused cannot demand a searching inquiry and trial as in Sec. 3 (People v. Madraga, in Tiu).`,
			hypo: `The accused pleads guilty to homicide. The court may receive evidence on mitigating circumstances (e.g., voluntary surrender) to fix the penalty.`

			n: '5',
			title: 'Withdrawal of improvident plea of guilty',
			text: `"At any time before the judgment of conviction becomes final, the court may permit an improvident plea of guilty to be withdrawn and be substituted by a plea of not guilty."`,
			plain: `A guilty plea made without understanding its consequences can be withdrawn any time before the judgment becomes final.`,
			when: `Before finality of the judgment of conviction.`,
			effect: `On appeal, if the improvident plea was the sole basis of conviction, the case is remanded; if there is independent evidence, the conviction may stand (Documento; Gambao).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('documento', 'People v. Documento (2010)')}; <i>People v. Gambao</i> (2013).`,

			text: `"Before arraignment, the court shall inform the accused of his right to counsel and ask him if he desires to have one. Unless the accused is allowed to defend himself in person or has employed a counsel of his choice, the court must assign a counsel de oficio to defend him."`,
			plain: `Before arraignment, the judge must tell him he has a right to a lawyer and assign one if he has none.`,
			effect: `Arraignment without counsel (and without leave to defend himself) is void.`,
			hypo: `The judge arraigns an unrepresented accused without asking if he wants counsel. The arraignment must be redone.`
		},
		{
			n: '7',
			title: 'Appointment of counsel de oficio',
			text: `Considering the gravity of the offense and the difficulty of the questions, the court shall appoint as counsel de oficio only members of the bar in good standing who can competently defend the accused; where such lawyers are not available, any person, resident of the province and of good repute for probity and ability.`,
			plain: `Appoint a competent lawyer; where none is available, a respected local resident.`,
			hypo: `In a remote municipality without available lawyers, the court appoints a respected retired teacher to assist the accused at arraignment. Allowed by Sec. 7.`

			n: '8',
			title: 'Time for counsel de oficio to prepare for arraignment',
			text: `Whenever counsel de oficio is appointed for arraignment, he shall be given a reasonable time to consult with the accused as to his plea before proceeding.`,
			plain: `Give the appointed lawyer time to talk with the accused before the plea.`,
			hypo: `A lawyer appointed at 9:00 a.m. is asked to proceed with the arraignment at 9:01. He should be given reasonable time to consult.`
		},
		{
			n: '9',
			title: 'Bill of particulars',
			text: `"The accused may, before arraignment, move for a bill of particulars to enable him properly to plead and to prepare for trial. The motion shall specify the alleged defects of the complaint or information and the details desired."`,
			plain: `If the information is too vague, ask before arraignment for the specific details needed to plead and prepare.`,
			reqs: `(1) Before arraignment; (2) specify the defects and the details desired (Tiu adds: the paragraphs where they appear, applying the Rules of Civil Procedure suppletorily).`,
			when: `Before arraignment; compliance within 10 days from notice under the civil rule applied suppletorily (Tiu, p. 155).`,
			effect: `Failure to move before arraignment waives the defect (People v. Jalbuena, in Tiu; People v. Solar). If the prosecution fails to comply, the case may be dismissed for failure to prosecute or the vague averments disregarded.`,
			cases: `${caseLink('solar', 'People v. Solar (2019)')} — the bill of particulars is a remedy for a qualifying circumstance alleged without its ultimate facts.`,
			hypo: `An information alleges "conspiracy" and "treachery" without facts. Before arraignment, the accused moves for particulars on the acts constituting treachery. The prosecution must supply them or treachery cannot be appreciated.`,

		{
			n: '11',
			title: 'Suspension of arraignment',
			text: `Upon motion by the proper party, arraignment shall be suspended: (a) when the accused appears to be suffering from an unsound mental condition which effectively renders him unable to fully understand the charge and to plead intelligently — the court orders mental examination and, if necessary, confinement; (b) when there exists a prejudicial question; and (c) when a petition for review of the prosecutor's resolution is pending at the DOJ or the Office of the President, "provided, that the period of suspension shall not exceed sixty (60) days counted from the filing of the petition with the reviewing office."`,
			plain: `Three grounds to postpone arraignment: the accused cannot understand (mental condition), a prejudicial civil case, or a pending DOJ/OP appeal (max 60 days).`,

			when: `Before arraignment; for (c), not beyond 60 days from filing of the petition with the reviewing office.`,
			exceptions: `A motion for reconsideration pending with the prosecutor (or Ombudsman) is not a ground (Ramiscal v. Sandiganbayan, 2010, in Tiu). Once arraigned before filing a petition for review, the DOJ must dismiss the petition (Adasa v. Abalos, 2007).`,
			effect: `Excluded from the 30-day arraignment period (Sec. 1[g]). Under the 2017 Guidelines, a motion to suspend on grounds not in Sec. 11 is prohibited; a motion based on unsound mental condition or prejudicial question is meritorious.`,
