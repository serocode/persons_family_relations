	plain: `After arraignment, the court must hold a pre-trial before trial. It is the last practical chance to plea bargain, and the time to agree on facts that need not be proved, mark the exhibits, waive objections to evidence, and fix the trial schedule. Anything the accused admits at pre-trial binds him only if it is in writing and signed by him and his lawyer. The court then issues a pre-trial order that controls the trial. The criminal liability itself cannot be compromised, but the civil liability in certain crimes can be mediated.`,
	purpose: `To abbreviate the trial by identifying contested issues, securing stipulations and marking evidence, and to explore plea bargaining and settlement of the civil aspect.`,
	stage: `After arraignment (${ruleLink('r116')}) and before trial (${ruleLink('r119')}). Under the 2017 Guidelines, arraignment and pre-trial are set together; mediation of the civil aspect follows them.`,
	questions: [
		'In which courts and when is pre-trial mandatory?',
		'What matters are taken up at pre-trial?',
		'What makes a pre-trial admission usable against the accused?',
		'What happens if counsel, the prosecutor, the accused or the offended party does not appear?',
		'What does the pre-trial order contain, and what is its effect?',
		'Can a criminal case be compromised or mediated?',
		'What discovery is available in criminal cases?'
	],
	relations: `Plea bargaining at pre-trial is governed by ${ruleLink('r116', 'sections', 'Rule 116, Sec. 2')} (before trial). Stipulations limit the issues for ${ruleLink('r119')}; modification of the order of trial when the accused admits the act but raises a lawful defense corresponds to ${ruleLink('r119', 'sections', 'Rule 119, Sec. 11[e]')}. Discovery draws on ${ruleLink('r116', 'sections', 'Rule 116, Sec. 10')} and the conditional examination rules of Rule 119 (Secs. 12–15). Compromise rules connect with ${ruleLink('r111')} (civil liability).`,

		'<b>Pre-trial is mandatory</b> in all criminal cases in the Sandiganbayan, RTCs and first-level courts; the court cannot skip it (OCA v. Español, 2004, in Tiu).',
		'<b>Admissions bind the accused only if written and signed by him and counsel</b> (Sec. 2).',
		'<b>The pre-trial order binds the parties, limits the trial and controls its course</b>, unless modified to prevent manifest injustice (Sec. 4).',
		'<b>No "as in default" in criminal pre-trial</b>: the sanctions for non-appearance fall on counsel and the prosecutor (Sec. 3).',

			text: `In all criminal cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan, RTC, MeTC, MTCC, MTC and MCTC, the court shall, after arraignment and within thirty days from the date it acquires jurisdiction over the person of the accused (unless a shorter period is provided), order a pre-trial conference to consider: "(a) plea bargaining; (b) stipulation of facts; (c) marking for identification of evidence of the parties; (d) waiver of objections to admissibility of evidence; (e) modification of the order of trial if the accused admits the charge but interposes a lawful defense; and (f) such matters as will promote a fair and expeditious trial of the criminal and civil aspects of the case."`,
			plain: `After arraignment, every criminal case goes to pre-trial: plea bargaining, agreed facts, marking of exhibits, waivers of objections, a reversed order of trial if the accused admits the act but claims a defense, and anything else that speeds up the trial.`,
			reqs: `Arraignment first; notice; the six matters.`,
			who: `Court; prosecutor; accused and counsel; private offended party (for plea bargaining and civil liability).`,
			when: `Within 30 days from the court's acquisition of jurisdiction over the accused; 10 days after arraignment if detained (Rule 116, Sec. 1[e]); A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC: within 30 days after arraignment, 10 days if detained; 2017 Guidelines: set together with arraignment.`,
			exceptions: `Plea bargaining in drug cases follows the Supreme Court framework (Estipona; Montierro).`,
			effect: `Skipping pre-trial is error (OCA v. Español). Evidence not marked and witnesses not named at pre-trial may be excluded at trial except for good cause (A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC).`,
			cases: `<i>OCA v. Español</i> (2004, in Tiu) — pre-trial cannot be dispensed with.`,
			hypo: `The accused admits stabbing the victim but claims self-defense. At pre-trial, the court may modify the order of trial so that the defense presents its evidence first.`,
			trap: `Stipulation of facts at pre-trial is a judicial admission — whatever is admitted need not be proved — but only if Sec. 2's formalities are met.`,
			update: `2017 Revised Guidelines (A.M. No. 15-06-10-SC): III.8 sets arraignment and pre-trial within 10 calendar days from the court's receipt of the case (detained) or 30 days from acquisition of jurisdiction (others); III.9 refers listed cases to mediation on the civil liability after arraignment and pre-trial, to be terminated within 30 days; III.12 requires stipulations on the testimony of witnesses without personal knowledge of the material facts (forensic chemists, medico-legal officers, custodians, experts, corroborative witnesses, witnesses on civil liability).`
