		facts: 'Arambulo (as reproduced in Tiu): a libel complaint was filed with the Quezon City prosecutor forty-two days after publication. The prosecutor found a prima facie case but filed the information with the Metropolitan Trial Court, which had no jurisdiction over libel. The accused argued the one-year period ran again when the prosecutor recommended filing, and that the case had prescribed.',
		issue: 'Does a complaint filed for preliminary investigation, or an information filed in a court without jurisdiction, interrupt prescription?',
		ruling: 'Yes. The filing interrupted prescription, and the period did not run again when the prosecutor recommended filing, because the proceedings had not terminated — they continued.',
		doctrine: 'Olarte: the filing of the complaint with the municipal court, "even if it be merely for purposes of preliminary examination or investigation," interrupts prescription, even if the court cannot try the case on the merits. Reasons: Art. 91 does not distinguish; the filing is the initial step of the proceedings; and it is unjust to deprive the injured party of vindication on account of delays not under his control.',
		reasoning: 'Art. 91 speaks of the filing of "the complaint or information" without distinguishing purpose; prescription runs again only when proceedings terminate without conviction or acquittal, or are unjustifiably stopped.',
		rule: 'RPC Art. 91; Rule 110, Sec. 1.',
		args: 'The accused\'s premise — that the period resumed when the prosecutor recommended filing — was rejected because that recommendation continued, not ended, the proceedings.',
		hypo: 'A complaint is filed with a prosecutor, who mistakenly files the information in a court without jurisdiction; the case is dismissed and refiled in the proper court. The first filing interrupted prescription; the period runs again only from the dismissal.',

		issue: 'Did the filing with the prosecutor interrupt the two-month prescriptive period for ordinance violations?',
		ruling: 'No. The period ended on July 11, 1990; it was not interrupted by the filing with the prosecutor, which "was not a judicial proceeding." The offense had prescribed.',
		doctrine: 'For offenses under the Rule on Summary Procedure (including ordinance violations), the case is deemed commenced only when filed in court; "proceedings" in Act 3326, Sec. 2 meant judicial proceedings; and if Rule 110 conflicts with the Rule on Summary Procedure or with Act 3326, Rule 110 yields, because prescription is substantive and the Court\'s rule-making power cannot modify it.',

		facts: 'The petitioner filed a complaint-affidavit for violation of BP 22 with the Office of the City Prosecutor on August 24, 1995. The respondents argued that the offense had prescribed because no information was filed in court within the four-year period of Act 3326.',
		issue: 'For a special law (BP 22) governed by Act 3326, does filing the complaint with the prosecutor interrupt prescription?',
		ruling: 'Yes. The filing "signified the commencement of the proceedings for the prosecution of the accused and thus effectively interrupted the prescriptive period."',
		doctrine: 'BP 22 prescribes in four years under Act 3326. "Proceedings" in Act 3326, Sec. 2 should now be understood as either executive or judicial in character: "any kind of investigative proceeding instituted against the guilty person which may ultimately lead to his prosecution should be sufficient to toll prescription."',
		reasoning: 'When Act 3326 was passed in 1926, justices of the peace conducted preliminary investigations, so "judicial proceedings" then included investigation; the function has since moved to the executive.

		issue: 'Does an investigation by an administrative agency (the SEC) interrupt prescription under Act 3326?',

(2) The Court pronounced, prospectively, that the filing of the criminal complaint before the DOJ tolls prescription even for offenses covered by the 2022 Rules on Expedited Procedures.',

		reasoning: 'The DOJ now investigates nearly all criminal cases (DOJ Circulars No. 015 and 028, 2024), including through summary investigation; the offended party should not be prejudiced by delays not under its control (Olarte).

Act 3326, Sec. 2 as read in Panaguiton (2008), SEC v. Interport (2008), Pangilinan (2012), People v. Lee (2019) and Consebido (2025): "any kind of investigative proceeding instituted against the guilty person which may ultimately lead to his prosecution" tolls prescription; an agency investigation equivalent to preliminary investigation suffices (Interport).

			application: 'The Sec. 80 investigation is a statutory step whose purpose is to lead to the filing of a complaint with the prosecutor — it is the kind of executive, investigative proceeding Panaguiton and Interport had in mind, and the offended party (the State) should not lose its case to delays in the agency. But three facts decide it: (1) Nature of the complaint — a criminal complaint or report seeking investigation for prosecution, not merely an administrative case for confiscation or permit cancellation. (2) Authority of the receiving officer — a "legal officer" must be part of the office that conducts the Sec. 80 investigation (the forest officer or the DENR office assigned to the area); a complaint left with an officer who has no investigative function is not a proceeding against the offender. (3) Timing — it must be filed before the period ran out. On the period itself: Sec. 77 offenses are punished by the penalties of RPC Arts. 309–310 (qualified theft), so the period depends on the value of the forest products. Under Act 3326 (special law without its own period) the period is likely 8 or 12 years depending on the imprisonment prescribed; some argue Art. 90 applies because the penalty is borrowed from the RPC — state both.',

The strongest support is Interport, which treated an agency investigation as equivalent to preliminary investigation, and Sec. 80, which makes the DENR investigation a statutory gateway to prosecution. The strongest counter-argument is Merida: unlike the SEC under the Securities Regulation Code, the DENR investigation is not a mandatory first step, so the DENR is not the only body whose proceedings "may lead to prosecution" — but non-exclusivity did not stop the Ombudsman\'s concurrent jurisdiction from tolling in Lee.',
