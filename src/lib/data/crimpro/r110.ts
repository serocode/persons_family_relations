/** Rule 110 — Prosecution of Offenses. Prescription itself has its own module (prescription.ts). */

	title: 'Prosecution of Offenses',
	short: 'R110 Prosecution of Offenses',
	tiu: 'pp. 32–52 (venue at pp. 17–21; prosecutorial agencies at pp. 22–31)',
	plain: `Rule 110 answers three practical questions: <b>where and how does a criminal case start</b>, <b>who is in charge of prosecuting it</b>, and <b>what must the charge sheet say</b>. A case starts when a complaint is filed with the office that will investigate it (or, for minor offenses outside chartered cities, directly with the MTC). The public prosecutor runs the case for the People; the victim is a witness who may intervene only for the civil liability. The complaint or information must tell the accused, in plain language, exactly what he is accused of, and it may be corrected (amended) or replaced (substituted) only within limits.`,
	purpose: `To fix the starting point of a criminal action (which also stops prescription), to keep prosecution under the State's control, and to guarantee the accused's constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation (Const., Art. III, Sec. 14[2]).`,
	stage: `The very beginning: from the filing of the complaint (institution) through the drafting and filing of the information in court, and — for amendment, substitution and venue — up to judgment. It sits before Rule 112 (preliminary investigation) in time but is read together with it.`,
	questions: [
		'How is a criminal action instituted, and does the answer change if preliminary investigation is required or if the place is a chartered city?',
		'What does institution do to the prescriptive period? (Detailed in the <a href="#prescription">prescription module</a>.)',
		'Who may sign a complaint, and who may sign an information?',
		'Who prosecutes — and when may a private prosecutor, the offended party, a peace officer or the Solicitor General act?',
		'Which crimes can be prosecuted only upon the complaint of the offended party or specified relatives?',
		'When is a complaint or information sufficient, and what happens if a required allegation is missing?',
		'When may the charge be amended, with or without leave of court, and when must it be substituted?',
		'Where must the action be instituted and tried, and what are the exceptions?'
	],
	relations: `Rule 110 hands off to ${ruleLink('r112')} (the complaint filed under Sec. 1 starts preliminary investigation), to ${ruleLink('r111')} (filing the criminal action impliedly institutes the civil action, which is why the offended party may intervene under Sec. 16), to ${ruleLink('r116')} (the accused pleads to the information as worded; a vague one is cured by a bill of particulars), to ${ruleLink('r117')} (defects in the information are attacked by motion to quash, and most are waived if not raised before plea), to ${ruleLink('r119')} (Sec. 19 governs substitution when the wrong offense was charged) and to ${ruleLink('r120')} (the variance rule: the accused can be convicted only of what is charged or necessarily included).`,
	principles: [
		'<b>Criminal actions are prosecuted in the name of the People</b> and under the direction and control of the public prosecutor; the offended party is a witness for the State.',
		'<b>The allegations, not the caption, determine the offense charged.</b> The real question is whether the accused did the acts alleged in the body of the information.',
		'<b>Qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be alleged</b> — by stating the ultimate facts, not just their names (<i>People v. Solar</i>, 2019) — or they cannot raise the penalty.',
		'<b>Before plea, amendment is generally free; after plea, only formal amendments with leave and without prejudice.</b>',
		'<b>Venue is jurisdictional in criminal cases.</b> Unlike civil venue, it cannot be waived.',
		'<b>Institution interrupts prescription</b> unless a special law provides otherwise.'

			title: 'Institution of criminal actions',
			text: `Criminal actions are instituted (a) for offenses that require preliminary investigation under Rule 112, Sec. 1 — by filing the complaint with the proper officer for the purpose of conducting the preliminary investigation; (b) for all other offenses — by filing the complaint or information directly with the Municipal Trial Court or Municipal Circuit Trial Court, or the complaint with the office of the prosecutor. In Manila and other chartered cities, the complaint is filed with the office of the prosecutor unless their charters provide otherwise. The last paragraph states: "The institution of the criminal action shall interrupt the running period of prescription of the offense charged unless otherwise provided in special laws."`,
			plain: `First ask: does the offense need preliminary investigation (penalty of at least 4 years, 2 months and 1 day)? If yes, file the complaint with the investigating office. If no, you may go straight to the MTC — except in Manila and chartered cities, where you file with the prosecutor.`,
			reqs: `(1) Determine whether preliminary investigation is required (Rule 112, Sec. 1). (2) Identify the "proper officer": the public prosecutor (DOJ National Prosecution Service), the Ombudsman (primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan) or the COMELEC (election offenses, concurrently with other prosecuting arms under RA 9369). (3) File a complaint (or, where allowed, an information) in the proper place.`,
			who: `Complainant (offended party, peace officer, or public officer charged with enforcing the law violated); the investigating officer; the MTC/MCTC for direct filing.`,
			when: `Any time before the offense prescribes. Filing is what interrupts prescription — see the <a href="#prescription">prescription module</a>.`,
			exceptions: `(1) "Unless otherwise provided in special laws" — a special law may fix its own interruption rule. (2) Direct filing with the court is not available in Manila and chartered cities (unless the charter allows it); Tiu notes there is no direct filing with the Metropolitan Trial Courts for this reason. (3) Under <i>Zaldivia</i> and <i>Jadewell</i>, ordinance and summary-procedure offenses were interrupted only by filing in court; <i>Consebido</i> (2025) changed this prospectively — see the update below.`,
			effect: `The criminal action is deemed instituted on filing with the proper officer, so prescription stops. The period runs again if the proceedings terminate without conviction or acquittal or are unjustifiably stopped for reasons not imputable to the accused (RPC Art. 91), or are dismissed for reasons not constituting jeopardy (Act 3326, Sec. 2).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('olarte', 'People v. Olarte (1967)')}; ${caseLink('panaguiton', 'Panaguiton v. DOJ (2008)')}; ${caseLink('pangilinan', 'People v. Pangilinan (2012)')}; ${caseLink('zaldivia', 'Zaldivia v. Reyes (1992)')}; ${caseLink('consebido', 'People v. Consebido (2025)')}.`,
			hypo: `Estafa involving ₱2 million is committed in Quezon City (a chartered city). The victim files a complaint-affidavit with the Office of the City Prosecutor. The criminal action is instituted on that date, and prescription stops, even though no information has yet been filed in court.`,
			trap: `"Institution" is not "filing in court." Students write that prescription stops only when the information reaches the court. For RPC offenses and most special laws that has not been the rule since <i>Francisco</i> (1983) and <i>Panaguiton</i> (2008).`,
			update: `(1) Since August 2005 (A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC), first-level court judges no longer conduct preliminary investigation (Tiu, p. 33). (2) <i>People v. Consebido</i>, G.R. No. 258563, April 2, 2025 (En Banc): henceforth, filing the criminal complaint before the DOJ tolls prescription even for offenses covered by the 2022 Rules on Expedited Procedures; the ruling is prospective, and <i>Republic v. Desierto</i> (2023) and <i>Corpus v. People</i> (2023) are abandoned on that point. (3) DOJ Department Circulars No. 015 and No. 028 (2024) now set the prosecutors' internal procedure — see ${ruleLink('r112')}.`

			title: 'The complaint or information',
			text: `The complaint or information shall be in writing, in the name of the People of the Philippines, and against all persons who appear to be responsible for the offense involved.`,
			plain: `Three requirements: written, titled "People of the Philippines v. …", and naming everyone who appears responsible.`,
			reqs: `Writing; the People as plaintiff; all persons who appear responsible as accused.`,
			who: `The People (plaintiff); the accused; the offended party is not a party to the criminal aspect.`,
			exceptions: `None in the text. Prosecutorial discretion still decides who "appears" responsible after preliminary investigation.`,
			effect: `Because the People is the party, only the State (through the Solicitor General on appeal) may appeal the criminal aspect of a dismissal or acquittal; the private complainant may appeal only the civil aspect (${caseLink('villareal', 'Villareal v. Aliga, 2014')}).`,
			hypo: `A, B and C conspire in a robbery. The information names only A and B. The information is not void as to A and B; C may be added by amendment (before plea, without leave), or charged separately.`,
			trap: `A private complainant who files a petition for review in the Court of Appeals assailing an acquittal "in the name of the People" lacks standing on the criminal aspect. Only the OSG represents the People there.`

			n: '3',
			title: 'Complaint defined',
			text: `A complaint is a sworn written statement charging a person with an offense, subscribed by the offended party, any peace officer, or other public officer charged with the enforcement of the law violated.`,
			plain: `A complaint is a sworn charge signed by the victim, a police officer, or the official in charge of enforcing the law that was broken.`,
			reqs: `(1) Written; (2) sworn; (3) charges a person with an offense; (4) subscribed by one of the three persons named.`,
			who: `Offended party; any peace officer; other public officer charged with enforcing the law violated (e.g., a forest officer for Forestry Code violations, a customs officer for customs offenses).`,
			exceptions: `For private crimes (Sec. 5), only the persons named in that section may file the complaint.`,
			effect: `A complaint signed by someone outside the list is not a "complaint" under Rule 110. It may still be an affidavit-complaint that starts preliminary investigation before the prosecutor.`,
			cases: `Tiu (citing Prof. Salvador) distinguishes the Rule 110 "complaint" that can be filed directly in court from the "affidavit-complaint" filed with the prosecutor, which is governed by DOJ rules.`,
			hypo: `A neighbor who witnessed a theft executes a sworn statement and files it with the prosecutor. It cannot be filed directly in court as a Rule 110 complaint (he is neither offended party nor peace officer), but it validly starts preliminary investigation, after which the prosecutor files an information.`,
			trap: `Confusing "complainant" in preliminary investigation (anyone with knowledge, through an affidavit-complaint) with the restricted list of persons who may subscribe a Rule 110 complaint. See also <i>Merida v. People</i> (2008) in the <a href="#prescription">prescription module</a>: a private person may file a Forestry Code complaint with the prosecutor.`
		},
		{
			n: '4',
			title: 'Information defined',
			text: `An information is an accusation in writing charging a person with an offense, subscribed by the prosecutor and filed with the court.`,
			plain: `An information is the prosecutor's written charge filed in court. It need not be sworn because the prosecutor acts under the oath of office.`,
			reqs: `(1) Written; (2) charges a person with an offense; (3) subscribed by the prosecutor; (4) filed with the court.`,
			who: `Only a public officer who is a "prosecutor" may subscribe it. Under Rule 112, Sec. 4, the information needs the prior written authority or approval of the provincial or city prosecutor or chief state prosecutor (or the Ombudsman or deputy).`,
			effect: `Filing of the information in court gives the court jurisdiction over the case; from then on, its disposition rests on the court's sound discretion (${caseLink('crespo', 'Crespo v. Mogul')}). An information filed without the required authority is quashable under Rule 117, Sec. 3(d), but the defect is waived if not raised before plea (${caseLink('villa-gomez', 'Villa Gomez v. People, 2020')}).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('villa-gomez', 'Villa Gomez v. People (2020, En Banc)')}; Tiu (pp. 44) still reports the older view (Prof. Salvador; Riano citing <i>Cudia v. CA</i>) that lack of authority "cannot be cured by silence, acquiescence, or even by express consent."`,
			hypo: `An assistant city prosecutor files an information without the city prosecutor's written approval. The accused is arraigned without objecting. After the prosecution rests, he moves to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Under <i>Villa Gomez</i>, the motion fails: the defect is not jurisdictional and was waived.`,
			trap: `Answering with the pre-2020 rule. Write both: "Formerly treated as jurisdictional (Cudia; Quisay); abandoned in Villa Gomez v. People (2020, En Banc)."`,
			update: `<i>Villa Gomez v. People</i>, G.R. No. 216824, November 10, 2020 (En Banc): the lack of prior written authority "has nothing to do with a trial court's acquisition of jurisdiction"; it may be waived through silence, acquiescence, or failure to raise it during arraignment; prior contrary doctrines (including <i>Villa v. Ibañez</i>, <i>Turingan</i>, <i>Quisay</i>) are abandoned; and the court may not dismiss on this ground motu proprio.`

			n: '5',
			title: 'Who must prosecute criminal actions',
			text: `All criminal actions, whether commenced by complaint or information, "shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of a public prosecutor." If the public prosecutor has a heavy work schedule or there is a lack of public prosecutors, the private prosecutor may be authorized in writing by the Chief of the Prosecution Office or the Regional State Prosecutor to prosecute, subject to the court's approval; once authorized, he continues up to the end of trial unless the authority is revoked or withdrawn (A.M. No. 02-2-07-SC, effective May 1, 2002). In MTC/MCTC cases, when the prosecutor is not available, the offended party, any peace officer, or the public officer charged with enforcing the law violated may prosecute; that authority ends upon the prosecutor's actual intervention or the elevation of the case to the RTC (OCA Circular No. 39-2002). The section also restates the private-crime rules (adultery and concubinage; seduction, abduction and acts of lasciviousness; defamation imputing those offenses) and provides that prosecution for violation of special laws is governed by those laws.`,
			plain: `The State's lawyer runs every criminal case. A private lawyer can take over the courtroom work only with written authority approved by the court. A few "private crimes" cannot even begin unless the victim (or specified relatives) files the complaint.`,
			reqs: `Private prosecutor acting alone: (1) heavy work schedule or lack of public prosecutors; (2) written authority from the Chief of the Prosecution Office or Regional State Prosecutor; (3) approval of the court. Private crimes: complaint by the proper person, against both guilty parties (adultery/concubinage) and without consent or pardon.`,
			who: `Public prosecutor; private prosecutor; offended party, peace officer or public officer (MTC only, prosecutor unavailable); Solicitor General (appeals in the CA and SC); Ombudsman's special prosecutor (Sandiganbayan cases and their appeals to the SC).`,
			when: `Written authority lasts "up to the end of the trial" unless revoked. MTC authority of the offended party etc. lasts until the prosecutor actually intervenes or the case reaches the RTC.`,
			exceptions: `(1) Written authority (above). (2) MTC cases when the prosecutor is unavailable. (3) Special laws may provide their own rules on prosecution (e.g., referral to the SEC first for Securities Regulation Code violations — <i>SEC v. Interport</i>, cited in Tiu, p. 43).`,
			effect: `Proceedings held without the public prosecutor (and without a duly authorized private prosecutor) are a clear transgression of the Rules (${caseLink('pinote', 'Pinote v. Ayco, 2005')}); Tiu notes such proceedings are treated as void. In private crimes, without the proper complaint the State cannot prosecute.`,
			cases: `${caseLink('pinote', 'Pinote v. Ayco (2005)')}; ${caseLink('villareal', 'Villareal v. Aliga (2014)')}; <i>People v. Duca</i>, G.R. No. 171175, October 30, 2009 (OSG is the appellate counsel of the People; a CA acquittal rendered without hearing the OSG is void); <i>People v. Sandiganbayan</i>, G.R. No. 188165, December 11, 2013 (Ombudsman's special prosecutor represents the People in Sandiganbayan cases, RA 8249, Sec. 4[c]); ${caseLink('crespo', 'Crespo v. Mogul (1987)')} (prosecutor's discretion before filing; court's after filing).`,
			hypo: `The public prosecutor is sick. The private prosecutor, without written authority, presents two prosecution witnesses and the judge allows it. The testimony was taken in violation of Sec. 5; the proper course was to reset the hearing or obtain written authority approved by the court.`,
			trap: `Rape is <b>no longer</b> a private crime. RA 8353 (1997) reclassified it as a crime against persons, so it may be prosecuted without the victim's complaint. Do not list rape with seduction, abduction and acts of lasciviousness.`,

			n: '6',
			title: 'Sufficiency of complaint or information',
			text: `A complaint or information is sufficient if it states (1) the name of the accused; (2) the designation of the offense given by the statute; (3) the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense; (4) the name of the offended party; (5) the approximate date of the commission of the offense; and (6) the place where the offense was committed. When an offense is committed by more than one person, all of them shall be included.`,
			plain: `Six things make a charge sufficient: who did it, what crime, what acts, against whom, about when, and where.`,
			reqs: `All six items, plus the inclusion of all offenders.`,
			who: `The prosecutor (drafting); the court (passing on sufficiency); the accused (objecting).`,
			when: `Objections must be raised before plea, by motion to quash (Rule 117) or motion for bill of particulars (Rule 116, Sec. 9).`,
			exceptions: `The test is substantial, not literal: whether the crime is described "in intelligible terms with such particularity as to apprise the accused with reasonable certainty" of the offense charged (Tiu, p. 45).`,
			effect: `Failure to object before plea waives most formal defects, and evidence at trial can cure them (Tiu, p. 45). But an information that charges no offense at all is quashable at any stage (Rule 117, Sec. 9), and an accused can never be convicted of an offense not charged or necessarily included.`,
			cases: `<i>Lasoy v. Zenarosa</i> (2005) and <i>Miguel v. Sandiganbayan</i> (both in Tiu, p. 46): an information is valid if it states the statutory designation and the acts constituting the offense so that a person of ordinary intelligence knows what is meant.`,
			hypo: `An information for theft alleges the taking of "one cellular phone" from "a certain Maria" on "on or about March 2024" in "Quezon City, within the jurisdiction of this Court." It is sufficient: the name of the offended party is given, the date is approximate, and the place is within the court's territory.`,

			reqs: `True name or known appellation; or fictitious name plus a statement that the true name is unknown.`,
			effect: `Inserting the true name later is a formal amendment (<i>People v. Padica</i>, in Tiu, p. 50). A mistake in the name is not a mistake in identity, but identity must still be proven (<i>People v. Amodia</i>, in Tiu, p. 46).`,
			hypo: `"John Doe, alias Botyok" is charged. At trial, the accused is identified by the witnesses as Botyok and his true name turns out to be Roberto Cruz. The court orders the true name inserted; the conviction can stand on identity proven at trial.`,

			plain: `Name the crime (or cite the section if the law gives it no name), state the acts, and spell out every qualifying and aggravating circumstance.`,
			reqs: `(1) Statutory designation, or the section punishing the act; (2) averment of the acts or omissions; (3) qualifying and aggravating circumstances specified.`,
			effect: `A wrong or missing designation does not vitiate the information if the facts alleged clearly recite the crime (<i>Malto v. People</i>; <i>Licayco v. People</i> — Tiu, p. 46). But a qualifying or aggravating circumstance not alleged cannot be appreciated even if proven (Tiu, pp. 46–47).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('solar', 'People v. Solar (2019, En Banc)')} settled the split Tiu reports between <i>People v. Batin</i> (2007: the word "treachery" suffices) and <i>People v. Valdez</i> (2013: the word alone is a conclusion of law).`,
			hypo: `An information for murder alleges only that the killing was "with treachery and evident premeditation." The accused does not move to quash or ask for a bill of particulars, is arraigned and tried; treachery is proven. Under <i>Solar</i>, he is deemed to have waived the defect and treachery may be appreciated.`,

No. 225595, August 6, 2019 (En Banc): an information alleging a qualifying or aggravating circumstance must state the ultimate facts constituting it; a bare reference such as "with treachery" is insufficient. The remedy is a motion to quash under Rule 117, Sec. 3(e) or a motion for bill of particulars before arraignment; failure to use them waives the defect, and the circumstance may be appreciated if proven.`,

(b) If the true name is later disclosed, the court must cause it to be inserted. (c) For a juridical person, its name or any designation by which it is known suffices, without averring that it is a juridical person or organized under law.`,

			exceptions: `Complex crimes, special complex crimes, compound crimes and continued crimes, where the law prescribes a single penalty (Tiu, p. 47).`,
			effect: `Duplicity is a ground to quash (Rule 117, Sec. 3[f]). If the accused does not object before plea, it is waived (<i>People v. Tabio</i>, in Tiu, p. 47), and the court may convict of as many offenses as are charged and proved (Rule 120, Sec. 3).`,

An amendment before plea that downgrades the offense or excludes any accused requires a motion by the prosecutor, notice to the offended party and leave of court; the court must state its reasons and furnish all parties, especially the offended party, copies of its order. If it appears at any time before judgment that a mistake has been made in charging the proper offense, the court shall dismiss the original complaint or information upon the filing of a new one charging the proper offense under Rule 119, Sec. 19, provided the accused is not placed in double jeopardy; the court may require the witnesses to give bail.`,
			plain: `Before plea, the prosecutor may change almost anything — except that lowering the charge or dropping an accused needs the court's permission. After plea, only changes of form, with permission, that do not hurt the defense. If the wrong crime was charged altogether, file the right information and dismiss the old one (substitution).`,
			reqs: `Before plea: none, except motion + notice to offended party + leave for downgrading/excluding. After plea: (1) formal amendment only; (2) leave of court; (3) no prejudice. Substitution: (1) mistake in charging the proper offense; (2) before judgment; (3) new information filed; (4) no double jeopardy.`,
			who: `Prosecutor (moves to amend); court (grants leave; dismisses the original on substitution); offended party (entitled to notice when the charge is downgraded or an accused dropped).`,
			when: `Amendment without leave: before plea. Formal amendment with leave: after plea and during trial. Substitution: any time before judgment.`,
			exceptions: `Substantial amendment after plea is not allowed (Tiu notes an exception when it benefits the accused). The tests of prejudice: (1) does it change the nature of the crime; (2) would a defense under the original still be available; (3) would the accused's evidence apply equally to both (Tiu, pp. 49–50).`,
			effect: `Formal amendment: no new preliminary investigation and no new plea. Substantial amendment before plea may call for reinvestigation if it alters the charge. Substitution requires a new preliminary investigation and a new plea (Teehankee v. Madayag, quoted in ${caseLink('pacoy', 'Pacoy v. Cajigal')}).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('pacoy', 'Pacoy v. Cajigal (2007)')}; <i>Teehankee v. Madayag</i> (frustrated to consummated murder after the victim died — formal); <i>Almeda v. Villaluz</i> (adding recidivism and habitual delinquency — formal); <i>Fronda-Baggao v. People</i> (merging four illegal-recruitment informations into one for large-scale illegal recruitment — formal); <i>Mendez v. People</i> (2014) — all in Tiu, pp. 50–52.`,
			hypo: `After arraignment for homicide, the prosecutor seeks to amend the information to murder by adding detailed allegations that the accused shot the victim from behind while he was asleep. This adds a qualifying circumstance and raises the penalty; it is substantial and cannot be made after plea over the accused's objection.`,
			trap: `<i>Pacoy</i> is often misread as "homicide to murder after plea is formal." It was formal there only because <b>nothing in the recital of facts changed</b> — only the caption and preamble.`

		['Professor: "Mr. X, when is a criminal action instituted?"', 'Under Rule 110, Sec. 1, it depends on whether preliminary investigation is required. If required, by filing the complaint with the proper officer for preliminary investigation. If not, by filing the complaint or information directly with the MTC or MCTC, or the complaint with the prosecutor — and in chartered cities, only with the prosecutor. Institution interrupts prescription unless a special law provides otherwise.'],
		['"Why is the prosecution under the direction and control of the public prosecutor?"', 'Because a crime is an offense against the State; placing control in the prosecutor prevents malicious or unfounded prosecutions by private persons (Crespo v. Mogul). The offended party is only a witness for the State, though he may intervene through counsel for the civil liability.'],
		['"Is the designation in the caption controlling?"', 'No. The character of the crime is determined by the recital of ultimate facts in the body, not the caption or the law cited. An erroneous designation does not vitiate the information if the facts are properly alleged.'],
		['"Distinguish amendment from substitution in one sentence."', 'If the new charge is the same as, includes, or is included in the original, it is amendment; if it is a different offense, it is substitution, which requires leave, a new preliminary investigation and a new plea, and raises no double jeopardy.'],
		['"Can you amend homicide to murder after arraignment?"', 'Only if the facts constituting the qualifying circumstance were already alleged, so that the change is in the caption only (Pacoy v. Cajigal). Adding new facts that qualify the killing is substantial and not allowed after plea.'],
		['"What did Villa Gomez change?"', 'It held that an information filed without the head of office\'s prior written authority is not jurisdictionally defective; the defect is waived if not raised before plea, and courts cannot dismiss motu proprio on that ground. It abandoned the older cases.'],
		['"What are the private crimes?"', 'Adultery and concubinage; seduction, abduction and acts of lasciviousness; and defamation imputing any of them. Rape is no longer one.'],
		['"Where is libel filed?"', 'In the RTC where the article was printed and first published, or, for a private individual, where he resided at the time; for a public officer, where he held office (Manila or elsewhere).']
