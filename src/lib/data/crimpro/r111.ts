	short: 'R111 Civil Action',
	tiu: 'pp. 53–65',
	plain: `A crime usually hurts two parties: the State and the victim. Rule 111 deals with the victim's claim for money (restitution, reparation, indemnification). By default, that claim rides along with the criminal case — filing the criminal case automatically files the civil claim for damages arising from the crime. The victim can opt out by waiving it, reserving it, or filing it first. Some civil claims (for violation of rights, defamation, fraud, physical injuries, police neglect and quasi-delict) never ride along: they are "independent" and can be filed any time. The rule also tells you what happens to the civil claim when the accused is acquitted or dies, and when a civil case must be decided first because it controls the criminal case (prejudicial question).`,
	purpose: `To avoid multiple suits by trying the civil liability arising from the crime together with the criminal case, while protecting the offended party's choice to sue separately and keeping civil claims that arise from other sources independent.`,
	stage: `Runs alongside the whole criminal case — from institution (when the civil action is impliedly instituted) to judgment (which must state the civil liability) and appeal (the offended party may appeal the civil aspect). Prejudicial questions are raised during preliminary investigation or before the prosecution rests.`,
	questions: [
		'Which civil action is deemed instituted with the criminal action, and when is it not?',
		'How, when and by whom is the civil action reserved? When is reservation not allowed?',
		'What happens to a separate civil action once the criminal action is filed? How is it consolidated?',
		'Which civil actions are independent, and what does "independent" mean in practice?',
		'What is the effect on the civil liability of an acquittal, of the extinction of criminal liability, and of the death of the accused?',
		'Does a judgment in a civil action bar the criminal action?',
		'What is a prejudicial question, and how and where is it raised?'
	],
	relations: `Rule 111 explains why the offended party may intervene under ${ruleLink('r110', 'sections', 'Rule 110, Sec. 16')}; why a judgment of conviction must state the civil liability and why an acquittal must say whether the act did not exist (${ruleLink('r120')}, Sec. 2); and why the offended party may appeal the civil aspect even after acquittal. A prejudicial question suspends arraignment (${ruleLink('r116')}, Sec. 11[a]) and can be raised during preliminary investigation (${ruleLink('r112')}).`,
	principles: [
		'<b>Every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly liable</b> (RPC Art. 100) — unless the offense causes no damage (e.g., espionage, flight to an enemy country, as Tiu notes).',
		'<b>Only the civil liability ex delicto is deemed instituted</b> with the criminal action; civil liability from other sources (law, contract, quasi-delict) is not.',
		'<b>The criminal action takes precedence</b>: once it is filed, the separate civil action ex delicto is suspended (Sec. 2) — except where a prejudicial question requires the civil case to go first (Sec. 6).',
		'<b>Acquittal does not automatically extinguish civil liability</b>: it does only when the judgment finds that the act or omission from which civil liability may arise did not exist.',
		'<b>No double recovery</b> for the same act or omission (Sec. 3; Civil Code Art. 2177).'

			text: `(a) "When a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged shall be deemed instituted with the criminal action unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right to institute it separately or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action." The reservation "shall be made before the prosecution starts presenting its evidence and under circumstances affording the offended party a reasonable opportunity to make such reservation." Filing fees: for moral, nominal, temperate or exemplary damages not specified in the complaint or information, the fees are a first lien on the judgment; if specified, they are paid on filing; no filing fees for actual damages except as provided in the Rules. No counterclaim, cross-claim or third-party complaint may be filed by the accused in the criminal case; such causes of action may be litigated separately. (b) The criminal action for violation of BP 22 "shall be deemed to include the corresponding civil action. No reservation to file such civil action separately shall be allowed." Filing fees are paid in full on the amount of the check; a civil action already filed separately and not yet tried may be consolidated with the BP 22 case.`,
			plain: `File the criminal case and the victim's claim for damages from the crime is automatically filed too — unless the victim says "I waive it," "I'll file it separately," or has already filed it. In BP 22 cases, the civil claim always goes with the criminal case.`,
			reqs: `Implied institution: (1) a criminal action instituted; (2) civil liability arising from the offense charged; (3) no waiver, reservation or prior civil action. Reservation: express; before the prosecution presents evidence; with reasonable opportunity.`,
			who: `Offended party (waives, reserves, files separately, pays fees); accused (cannot counterclaim); court (must rule on civil liability).`,
			when: `Reservation: before the prosecution starts presenting evidence. Estafa: if the offended party does not manifest within 15 days after the information is filed that the civil liability will be prosecuted separately, fees under Rule 141, Sec. 21(a) are collected (Tiu, p. 55).`,
			exceptions: `(1) BP 22 — no reservation (Sec. 1[b]), though Tiu notes that waiver or prior institution of the civil action is not prohibited (Lo Bun Tiong v. Balboa). (2) Graft cases in the Sandiganbayan — Tiu (citing Prof. Salvador) lists them as cases where reservation is not allowed. (3) Independent civil actions (Sec. 3) are never deemed instituted.`,
			effect: `The criminal and civil actions merge into one proceeding with the criminal predominating; a conviction must state the civil liability (Hun Hyung Park v. Eun Won Choi, in Tiu). Failure to reserve in time means the civil action ex delicto is tried with the criminal case.`,
			cases: `${caseLink('hun-hyung-park', 'Hun Hyung Park v. Eun Won Choi')}; ${caseLink('casupanan', 'Casupanan v. Laroya (2002)')}; <i>Lo Bun Tiong v. Balboa</i> (in Tiu, p. 57).`,
			hypo: `V is injured in a stabbing. The prosecutor files frustrated homicide. V says nothing about the civil action. V's claim for medical expenses and moral damages is deemed instituted; V may present evidence of damages through a private prosecutor, and the judgment of conviction must award them if proven.`,
			trap: `The accused cannot file a counterclaim in the criminal case, but that does not leave him remediless: he may file a separate civil action (e.g., for quasi-delict against the complainant — Casupanan v. Laroya).`,

			title: 'When separate civil action is suspended',
			text: `After the criminal action has been commenced, the separate civil action arising therefrom cannot be instituted until final judgment has been entered in the criminal action. If the criminal action is filed after the civil action, the civil action "shall be suspended in whatever stage it may be found before judgment on the merits," until final judgment in the criminal action. Before judgment on the merits in the civil action, it may, on motion of the offended party, be consolidated with the criminal action; the evidence already adduced is deemed automatically reproduced, without prejudice to cross-examination and additional evidence, and the two are tried and decided jointly. During the pendency of the criminal action, the running of the prescriptive period of the civil action that cannot be instituted separately or has been suspended "shall be tolled." "The extinction of the penal action does not carry with it extinction of the civil action. However, the civil action based on delict shall be deemed extinguished if there is a finding in a final judgment in the criminal action that the act or omission from which the civil liability may arise did not exist."`,
			plain: `The criminal case goes first. A reserved civil case waits for final judgment in the criminal case; a civil case filed earlier is frozen — unless the victim moves to merge it into the criminal case. The clock on the civil claim stops while it waits.`,
			reqs: `Suspension: (1) civil action ex delicto (not independent); (2) criminal action filed. Consolidation: (1) separate civil action filed earlier; (2) motion by the offended party; (3) before judgment on the merits in the civil action; (4) in the court trying the criminal action.`,

It shall proceed independently of the criminal action and shall require only a preponderance of evidence. In no case, however, may the offended party recover damages twice for the same act or omission charged in the criminal action."`,
			plain: `Some civil claims do not come from the crime itself but from other legal sources — violation of rights, defamation, fraud, physical injuries, police failure to help, and quasi-delict. These can be filed and tried on their own, whatever happens in the criminal case.`,
			reqs: `A cause of action under Civil Code Art. 32, 33, 34 or 2176 (Tiu also lists Art. 31).`,

			exceptions: `No double recovery (Sec. 3; Art. 2177).`,

			cases: `${caseLink('casupanan', 'Casupanan v. Laroya (2002)')} — the accused in a reckless-imprudence case may file a separate quasi-delict action against the private complainant; no forum shopping.`,
			hypo: `A is charged with reckless imprudence resulting in physical injuries. Without reserving, the victim files a separate action for quasi-delict against A and A's employer. Both proceed; the victim cannot recover twice.`,
			trap: `"Physical injuries" in Art. 33 has been read to mean bodily injuries in the generic sense; and the independent action under Art. 33 for "fraud" covers estafa. But an Art. 33 action is still subject to the no-double-recovery rule. Do not say an independent action must be reserved — under the 2000 Rules it need not be.`,
			verify: `The scope of "physical injuries" in Art. 33 (whether it includes death or reckless imprudence) has varied in jurisprudence; it is not discussed in Tiu.`

			title: 'Effect of death on civil actions',
			text: `The death of the accused after arraignment and during the pendency of the criminal action extinguishes the civil liability arising from the delict. The independent civil action under Sec. 3, or one later instituted to enforce liability from other sources of obligation, may be continued against the estate or legal representative after proper substitution, or against the estate. The heirs may be substituted without appointment of an executor or administrator; the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for minor heirs. The court shall order the legal representative to appear and be substituted within thirty days from notice. A final judgment in favor of the offended party is enforced as a claim against the estate. If the accused dies before arraignment, the case is dismissed without prejudice to any civil action against the estate.`,

			plain: `Winning the civil case does not protect you from the criminal case.`,
			effect: `The State, not a party to the civil case, may still prosecute. Likewise, extinction of the civil liability (payment, compromise, novation) does not extinguish criminal liability (Civil Code Art. 2034; Metrobank v. Reynaldo, 2010, in Tiu).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('metrobank-reynaldo', 'Metropolitan Bank v. Reynaldo (2010)')}; <i>Cabico v. Dimaculangan</i> (in Tiu, p. 63): a judge cannot dismiss a criminal case because the civil liability has been paid.`,
