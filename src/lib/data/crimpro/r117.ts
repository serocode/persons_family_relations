	n: 117,
	title: 'Motion to Quash',
	short: 'R117 Motion to Quash',
	tiu: 'pp. 158–168',
	plain: `A motion to quash is the accused's attack on the information itself, before he pleads: the facts alleged are not a crime, the court has no jurisdiction, the signing officer had no authority, the information is badly drafted or charges two crimes, the offense has prescribed, the facts alleged show a legal excuse, or he has already been tried for it (double jeopardy). The court looks only at the face of the information. Most grounds are waived if not raised before plea; four are never waived. The Rule also governs double jeopardy and provisional dismissal — a dismissal with the accused's consent that becomes permanent if the case is not revived within one or two years.`,
	purpose: `To let the accused dispose of a legally defective charge before trial, while protecting the State's ability to correct curable defects by amendment and to refile when the defect does not go to the merits.`,
	stage: `After the information is filed and before the accused pleads (${ruleLink('r116')}). Non-waivable grounds may be raised later, even on appeal. Provisional dismissal can happen at any stage, even during trial.`,
	questions: [
		'When, and in what form, is a motion to quash filed?',
		'What are the grounds, and which are waived if not raised before plea?',
		'May the court look beyond the information?',
		'What happens when the motion is granted — dismissal, amendment, or refiling?',
		'When does double jeopardy attach, and what are its exceptions?',
		'What is a provisional dismissal, and when does it become permanent?'
	],
	relations: `Rule 117 attacks the information drafted under ${ruleLink('r110')} (sufficiency, authority, duplicity, venue); its deadline is the plea under ${ruleLink('r116')}. Prescription as a ground links to the <a href="#prescription">prescription module</a>. Double jeopardy depends on a valid arraignment (${ruleLink('r116')}) and is triggered by acquittals and certain dismissals in ${ruleLink('r119')} (demurrer; speedy trial; discharge as state witness) and ${ruleLink('r120')}.`,
	principles: [
		'<b>A motion to quash hypothetically admits the facts alleged</b>; the court looks only at the face of the information (People v. Odtuhan, 2013).',
		'<b>Omnibus motion rule</b>: all available grounds must be raised; those not raised before plea are waived — except (a) facts not constituting an offense, (b) lack of jurisdiction over the offense, (g) extinction of criminal liability, (i) double jeopardy (Sec. 9).',
		'<b>Curable defects lead to amendment, not dismissal</b> (Sec. 4).',
		'<b>Quashal is not a bar to refiling</b> — except when based on extinction of liability or double jeopardy (Sec. 6).',
		'<b>Double jeopardy</b> requires a first jeopardy that attached (valid information, competent court, arraignment and plea), validly terminated (conviction, acquittal, or dismissal without express consent), and a second prosecution for the same or an included offense.'

			plain: `Before plea.`,
			when: `Before plea (contrast the bill of particulars: before arraignment).`,
			exceptions: `Non-waivable grounds (Sec. 9) may be raised after plea, even on appeal. Under summary (now expedited) procedure, a motion to quash is generally prohibited except for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter or failure to comply with barangay conciliation (1991 Rule, Sec. 19 — carried over in the 2022 Rules; verify).`,
			effect: `Plea without a motion to quash waives the waivable grounds.`,
			hypo: `X is arraigned and pleads not guilty. A week later he moves to quash for duplicity. Too late — waived.`,

			plain: `Written, signed, grounds spelled out. The court rules only on what is raised — except lack of jurisdiction over the offense, which it may notice on its own.`,
			reqs: `(1) In writing; (2) signed by the accused or counsel; (3) factual and legal grounds distinctly specified.`,
			effect: `An oral motion to quash is not allowed. Grounds not stated are not considered (save lack of jurisdiction over the offense) — and are waived unless non-waivable.`,
			hypo: `The motion cites only duplicity. The information also shows on its face that the offense prescribed. The court may not quash on prescription unless raised — but prescription is non-waivable and may be raised later.`,
			trap: `Only lack of jurisdiction over the offense may be considered motu proprio. Under Villa Gomez (2020), the court may not dismiss motu proprio for lack of authority of the filing officer.`

			n: '3',
			title: 'Grounds',
			text: `The accused may move to quash on any of the following grounds: "(a) That the facts charged do not constitute an offense; (b) That the court trying the case has no jurisdiction over the offense charged; (c) That the court trying the case has no jurisdiction over the person of the accused; (d) That the officer who filed the information had no authority to do so; (e) That it does not conform substantially to the prescribed form; (f) That more than one offense is charged except when a single punishment for various offenses is prescribed by law; (g) That the criminal action or liability has been extinguished; (h) That it contains averments which, if true, would constitute a legal excuse or justification; and (i) That the accused has been previously convicted or acquitted of the offense charged, or the case against him was dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent."`,
			plain: `Nine grounds: no crime alleged; no jurisdiction over the offense; no jurisdiction over the person; no authority to file; defective form; two crimes in one; extinguished liability (e.g., prescription); the information itself shows a defense; already tried.`,
			reqs: `A ground in Sec. 3, apparent on the face of the information (except grounds like double jeopardy and extinction that require proof of prior proceedings or of facts such as death).`,
			exceptions: `Not grounds: affidavit of desistance; lack of probable cause; absence or irregularity of preliminary investigation; matters of defense such as self-defense not apparent from the information (Tiu, p. 162). A motion to quash on a ground not in Sec. 3 is a prohibited motion under the 2017 Guidelines.`,
			effect: `A motion on grounds (a), (b), (g) and (i) is a "meritorious motion" under the 2017 Guidelines (comment within 10 days; resolution within 10 days).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('odtuhan', 'People v. Odtuhan (2013)')} (hypothetical admission; no evidence aliunde); ${caseLink('villa-gomez', 'Villa Gomez v. People (2020)')} (ground [d] waivable); ${caseLink('solar', 'People v. Solar (2019)')} (ground [e] for qualifying circumstances alleged without ultimate facts).`,
			hypo: `An information for estafa alleges that the accused borrowed money and failed to pay, without alleging deceit or misappropriation. Ground (a): the facts do not constitute estafa. The court should first allow amendment (Sec. 4).`,
			trap: `Ground (h) is rare: it applies only when the information itself alleges facts showing a justification (e.g., that the accused acted to repel an unlawful aggression); a self-defense claim outside the information is a matter of defense for trial.`
		},
		{
			n: '4',
			title: 'Amendment of the complaint or information',
			text: `If the motion to quash is based on a defect that can be cured by amendment, the court shall order the amendment. If based on the ground that the facts charged do not constitute an offense, the prosecution shall be given an opportunity to correct the defect by amendment; the motion shall be granted if the prosecution fails to amend, or the information still suffers from the same defect despite the amendment.`,
			plain: `Fixable? Order an amendment first. Only if the prosecution fails or the fix does not work, quash.`,
			effect: `Immediate quashal without giving the opportunity to amend is error.`,
			hypo: `An information for murder omits the victim's name. The defect is curable — the court orders amendment instead of quashing.`,
			trap: `Even ground (a) — facts do not constitute an offense — is first met with an opportunity to amend.`

			title: 'Effect of sustaining the motion to quash',
			text: `If the motion is sustained, the court may order that another complaint or information be filed, except as provided in Sec. 6. If the order is made, the accused, if in custody, shall not be discharged unless admitted to bail. If no order is made, or if no new information is filed within the time specified or allowed, the accused, if in custody, shall be discharged unless also in custody for another charge.`,
			plain: `Quashed? The court may order refiling; meanwhile the detained accused stays unless he posts bail. If no refiling, he is released.`,
			effect: `"To quash" means to annul or vacate; it does not necessarily mean dismissal of the case (People v. Sandiganbayan, in Tiu).`,
			hypo: `The court quashes an information for lack of jurisdiction over the offense (filed in the MTC instead of the RTC) and orders the prosecutor to file in the RTC within 10 days. The detained accused stays detained unless he posts bail.`
		},
		{
			n: '6',
			title: 'Order sustaining the motion to quash not a bar to another prosecution; exception',
			text: `"An order sustaining the motion to quash is not a bar to another prosecution for the same offense unless the motion was based on the grounds specified in section 3 (g) and (i) of this Rule."`,
			plain: `A quashed charge can be refiled — unless it was quashed for extinction of liability or double jeopardy.`,
			effect: `The prosecution's remedies against a quashal on (g) or (i): motion for reconsideration or appeal (no jeopardy because the accused has not pleaded).`,
			hypo: `An information is quashed because the offense prescribed. The prosecution cannot refile; it may only seek reconsideration or appeal the order.`
		},
		{
			n: '7',
			title: 'Former conviction or acquittal; double jeopardy',
			text: `When an accused has been convicted or acquitted, or the case against him dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent, by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or information sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction, and after he had pleaded, the conviction, acquittal or dismissal is a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged, any attempt or frustration of it, or any offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in it. However, a conviction is not a bar to prosecution for an offense which necessarily includes the offense charged when: (a) the graver offense developed due to supervening facts arising from the same act or omission; (b) the facts constituting the graver charge became known or were discovered only after a plea was entered; or (c) the plea of guilty to the lesser offense was made without the consent of the prosecutor and of the offended party, except as provided in Rule 116, Sec. 1(f). In these cases, the accused is credited with any part of the judgment he has served.`,
			plain: `Once tried (convicted, acquitted, or dismissed without his consent) on a valid charge in a competent court after a plea, he cannot be tried again for the same offense or an included or including one — with three exceptions for graver offenses.`,
			reqs: `(1) First jeopardy attached: valid information; competent court; arraignment and valid plea. (2) First jeopardy validly terminated: conviction, acquittal, or dismissal without the accused\'s express consent (or with consent where it amounts to acquittal — demurrer, speedy trial, speedy disposition, discharge as state witness). (3) Second prosecution for the same offense, an attempt or frustration of it, or an offense that includes or is included in it.`,
			exceptions: `(a) Supervening facts (e.g., the victim of physical injuries dies after conviction); (b) facts discovered only after plea, despite diligence; (c) plea to a lesser offense without the prosecutor\'s and offended party\'s consent (save absence despite notice). Also, an acquittal rendered with grave abuse amounting to lack of jurisdiction (a sham trial, denial of due process to the prosecution) does not bar retrial (Galman v. Sandiganbayan; People v. Laguio, in Tiu).`,
			effect: `Ground (i) to quash; non-waivable. For quasi-offenses (Art. 365), a conviction or acquittal for one result bars prosecution for the other results of the same negligent act (Ivler v. Modesto-San Pedro, 2010).`,
			cases: `${caseLink('ivler', 'Ivler v. Modesto-San Pedro (2010)')}; <i>People v. Buan</i> (1968); <i>Bogo-Medellin Milling v. Son</i> (discharge as state witness is an acquittal, lost if he refuses to testify) — in Tiu.`,
			hypo: `A is convicted of serious physical injuries on his plea. Two weeks later, the victim dies from the same wounds. A may be prosecuted for homicide (supervening fact), credited with any time served.`,
			trap: `One act may constitute two distinct offenses under different laws (e.g., BP 22 and estafa; illegal recruitment and estafa; direct bribery and RA 3019) — prosecution for one does not bar the other, unless the act is punished by a law and an ordinance (Const., Art. III, Sec. 21) or the offenses are identical or included.`
		},
		{
			n: '8',
			title: 'Provisional dismissal',
			text: `"A case shall not be provisionally dismissed except with the express consent of the accused and with notice to the offended party." The provisional dismissal of offenses punishable by imprisonment not exceeding six years or a fine of any amount, or both, "shall become permanent one (1) year after issuance of the order without the case having been revived." For offenses punishable by imprisonment of more than six years, it becomes permanent two years after issuance of the order without the case having been revived.`,
			plain: `A dismissal "for now," with the accused's express consent and notice to the victim. If the State does not revive it within 1 year (≤6 years' imprisonment) or 2 years (>6 years), it becomes permanent.`,
			reqs: `(People v. Lacson, 2003): (1) the prosecution with the accused\'s express conformity, or the accused, or both, move for provisional dismissal; (2) the offended party is notified; (3) the court orders a provisional dismissal; (4) the public prosecutor is served a copy of the order.`,
			who: `Prosecution; accused (express consent — "no objection" or "with my conformity" written on the motion; mere silence is not express consent); offended party (notice); court.`,
			when: `Any time, even during trial (Tiu, citing Prof. Salvador). Time-bar: 1 or 2 years from issuance of the order (A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC, Sec. 14; 2017 Guidelines, III.7).`,
			exceptions: `If dismissed without the accused\'s express consent, Sec. 8 does not apply; revival is subject to double jeopardy and prescription (Lacson). Grounds listed in Sec. 3 call for a motion to quash, not a provisional dismissal (Los Baños v. Pedro, 2009). A motion to withdraw the information is different (Torres v. Aguinaldo, 2005).`,
			effect: `Before the time-bar, the case may be revived by refiling the information or filing a new one for the same or an included offense; no new preliminary investigation is needed unless there are new witnesses, new accused, an upgraded charge, or an upgraded participation (Lacson). After the time-bar, the dismissal is automatically permanent; A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC says it "shall amount to an adjudication of the case on the merits."`,
			cases: `${caseLink('lacson', 'People v. Lacson (2003)')}; ${caseLink('los-banos', 'Los Baños v. Pedro (2009)')}; <i>Torres v. Aguinaldo</i> (2005); <i>Saldariega v. Panganiban</i> (2015).`,
			hypo: `The prosecution's witnesses are abroad. With the accused's written conformity and notice to the victim, the court provisionally dismisses a robbery case (more than 6 years) on March 1, 2026. The State must revive by March 1, 2028.`,
			trap: `The time-bar counts from <b>issuance</b> of the order (A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC; 2017 Guidelines), not from the prosecution's receipt — older rulings (Lacson) reckoned from receipt.`,
			update: `2017 Revised Guidelines for Continuous Trial, III.7, restates the 1- and 2-year periods "after issuance of the order."`
		},
		{
			n: '9',
			title: 'Failure to move to quash or to allege any ground therefor',
			text: `"The failure of the accused to assert any ground of a motion to quash before he pleads to the complaint or information, either because he did not file a motion to quash or failed to allege the same in said motion, shall be deemed a waiver of any objections except those based on the grounds provided for in paragraphs (a), (b), (g), and (i) of section 3 of this Rule."`,
			plain: `Not raised before plea = waived, except: no offense charged, no jurisdiction over the offense, extinguished liability, double jeopardy.`,
			effect: `Waived: lack of jurisdiction over the person (c), lack of authority (d — Villa Gomez), defective form (e), duplicity (f), legal excuse on the face (h). Not waived: (a), (b), (g), (i).`,
			hypo: `After conviction, the accused argues on appeal that the information charged two offenses. Waived; the court may convict of both if proved (Rule 120, Sec. 3).`,
			trap: `Tiu reproduces Sec. 9 in a version that reads "shall be deemed a waiver of any objections based on the grounds…(a), (b), (g), and (i)," but his own discussion — and the settled rule — treats (a), (b), (g) and (i) as the exceptions that are <b>not</b> waived. Recite it as the exceptions.`,
