export const r119: RuleChapter = {
	id: 'r119',
	n: 119,
	title: 'Trial',
	short: 'R119 Trial',
	tiu: 'pp. 181–196 (with RA 8493, A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC, RA 6981 and immunity statutes; 2017 Guidelines at pp. 249–255)',
	plain: `Rule 119 runs the trial: when it starts (within 30 days of the pre-trial order), how long it can last (180 days, minus excused delays), when it may be postponed, and in what order the parties present evidence. It also covers getting testimony early from witnesses who may not be available, discharging a co-accused to testify for the State, fixing a wrongly charged offense, excluding the public, and two key exits: the demurrer to evidence (the accused says the prosecution's evidence is not enough) and reopening the case before judgment becomes final.`,
	purpose: `To secure a speedy, orderly trial consistent with the accused's rights, with tools to preserve testimony, obtain the testimony of a participant, and end weak prosecutions early.`,
	stage: `After pre-trial (${ruleLink('r118')}) and before judgment (${ruleLink('r120')}). A demurrer comes after the prosecution rests; reopening may happen any time before the judgment of conviction becomes final.`,
	questions: [
		'When must trial begin and end, and which delays are excluded?',
		'When may trial be postponed, and what grounds are prohibited?',
		'What is the order of trial, and when may it be reversed?',
		'How is the testimony of an unavailable defense or prosecution witness preserved?',
		'When may an accused be discharged to be a state witness, and what is the effect?',
		'What happens when the wrong offense was charged?',
		'How does a demurrer to evidence work, with and without leave?',
		'When may the proceedings be reopened?'
	],
	relations: `Rule 119 implements the right to speedy trial (${ruleLink('r115')}) and builds on the pre-trial order (${ruleLink('r118')}). Sec. 19 is the trial-stage counterpart of substitution under ${ruleLink('r110', 'sections', 'Rule 110, Sec. 14')}. A granted demurrer or a state-witness discharge operates as an acquittal for double jeopardy (${ruleLink('r117', 'sections', 'Rule 117, Sec. 7')}). The case is then decided under ${ruleLink('r120')}.`,
	principles: [
		'<b>Continuous trial</b>: once begun, trial proceeds day to day as far as practicable; the whole trial may not exceed 180 days from its first day, excluding allowed delays (Sec. 2).',
		'<b>Postponements are the exception</b>; congestion, lack of preparation, and failure to obtain available prosecution witnesses are never grounds (Sec. 4).',
		'<b>The prosecution\'s choice of state witness deserves deference</b>; courts deny discharge only in clear cases of non-compliance with Sec. 17 (People v. Sandiganbayan, 2013; Ampatuan v. De Lima, 2013).',
		'<b>A granted demurrer is an acquittal</b> — not appealable; only certiorari for grave abuse (Dayap v. Sendiong).',
		'<b>A demurrer without leave is a gamble</b>: if denied, the accused loses the right to present evidence.'

			when: `15 days minimum preparation; 30 days from receipt of the pre-trial order.`,
			effect: `Failure to start on time (minus exclusions) supports a motion to dismiss for denial of speedy trial (Sec. 9).`,

			title: 'Continuous trial until terminated; postponements',
			text: `"Trial once commenced shall continue from day to day as far as practicable until terminated. It may be postponed for a reasonable period of time for good cause." The court, after consulting the prosecutor and defense counsel, sets the case for continuous trial on a weekly or short-term calendar. "In no case shall the entire trial period exceed one hundred eighty (180) days from the first day of trial, except as otherwise authorized by the Supreme Court." Shorter periods in special laws or circulars apply.`,
			plain: `Trial runs continuously; 180 days maximum from the first day, unless the SC allows more.`,
			when: `180 days from the first day of trial (A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC: 60 days if by judicial affidavits, for detained accused).`,
			exceptions: `Excluded delays (Sec. 3); shorter periods in special laws (e.g., RA 9165, Sec. 90: 60 days).`,
			effect: `Unjustified extension may violate speedy trial.`,
			hypo: `A trial that began on January 10 should end by early July, unless delays are excluded.`,
			update: `2017 Revised Guidelines: trial Monday to Thursday; motions, arraignment, pre-trial and promulgation on Friday mornings; postponements prohibited except for acts of God, force majeure, or physical inability of the witness (with a postponement fee); "one-day examination of witness rule"; oral offer of evidence on the day of the last witness.`

			n: '3',
			title: 'Exclusions',
			text: `Excluded in computing the time within which trial must commence: (a) delay from other proceedings concerning the accused — mental or physical examination; other criminal charges; extraordinary remedies against interlocutory orders; pre-trial proceedings (not exceeding 30 days); inhibition, change of venue or transfer; a finding of a prejudicial question; and a proceeding under advisement (not exceeding 30 days); (b) absence or unavailability of an essential witness; (c) mental incompetence or physical inability of the accused; (d) where the information is dismissed on the prosecution's motion and refiled for the same offense, the period from dismissal to when the time limit would have run on the new charge; (e) a reasonable period when the accused is joined with a co-accused over whom the court has no jurisdiction or for whom time has not run, and no separate trial was granted; and (f) a continuance granted on findings that the ends of justice outweigh the interest in a speedy trial.`,
			plain: `Delays caused by legitimate proceedings, missing essential witnesses, the accused's incapacity, refiling, co-accused, or justified continuances do not count.`,
			reqs: `Essential witness "absent" when whereabouts unknown or cannot be determined by due diligence; "unavailable" when whereabouts known but presence cannot be obtained by due diligence.`,
			effect: `The prosecution bears the burden of going forward with evidence of exclusions (Sec. 9).`,
			hypo: `Trial is delayed 45 days while the CA resolves the accused's certiorari petition against an interlocutory order. Those 45 days are excluded.`,
			trap: `Pre-trial delay and "under advisement" periods are excluded only up to 30 days each.`
		},
		{
			n: '4',
			title: 'Factors for granting continuance',
			text: `The court considers, among others: (a) whether denial would likely make continuation impossible or result in a miscarriage of justice; and (b) whether the case is so novel, unusual and complex (number of accused, nature of the prosecution) that adequate preparation within the time limits is unreasonable. "No continuance … shall be granted because of congestion of the court's calendar or lack of diligent preparation or failure to obtain available witnesses on the part of the prosecutor."`,
			plain: `Postpone only to avoid injustice or for genuinely complex cases — never for a busy docket, an unprepared lawyer, or a prosecutor who did not get available witnesses.`,
			exceptions: `Prohibited grounds: court congestion; lack of diligent preparation; prosecutor's failure to obtain available witnesses.`,
			effect: `A continuance on prohibited grounds is not excluded from the time limits.`,
			hypo: `The prosecutor asks for postponement because he did not subpoena a witness who lives nearby. Prohibited ground.`

		{
			n: '5',
			title: 'Time limit following an order for new trial',
			text: `If the accused is to be tried again after an order for new trial, trial shall commence within thirty days from notice of the order; if impractical due to unavailability of witnesses or other factors, the court may extend it, but not beyond 180 days from notice.`,
			plain: `Retrial within 30 days of the new-trial order; at most 180 days.`,
			when: `30 days (extendible to 180) from notice of the order.`,
			hypo: `A new trial is granted on newly discovered evidence; the retrial must start within 30 days of notice unless extended for good reason.`

			n: '6',
			title: 'Extended time limit',
			text: `For the first twelve months following September 15, 1998, the arraignment-to-trial limit was 180 days; for the second twelve months, 120 days; for the third, 80 days.`,
			plain: `Transitional limits after the Speedy Trial Act: 180, then 120, then 80 days.`,
			trap: `Tiu presents "80 days from arraignment to trial" as a working limit; strictly, Sec. 6 was a three-year transition. The standing limits are Rule 116, Sec. 1(g) (arraignment within 30 days) and Sec. 1 of this Rule (trial within 30 days of the pre-trial order).`,
			verify: `Confirm with your professor whether the 80-day figure is tested.`

			n: '7',
			title: 'Public attorney\'s duties where accused is imprisoned',
			text: `If the public attorney knows that the accused is detained (cannot post bail, non-bailable, or serving sentence), he shall promptly seek the prisoner's presence for trial or notify the custodian to advise the prisoner of his right to demand trial; the custodian promptly advises the prisoner and relays any demand; the public attorney then seeks the prisoner's presence; the custodian makes him available upon a properly supported request.`,
			plain: `PAO lawyers must actively get detained clients to trial.`,
			hypo: `A PAO lawyer learns his client is serving sentence in another case in Bilibid; he must notify the custodian so the client can demand trial.`

			n: '8',
			title: 'Sanctions',
			text: `Private counsel, public attorney or prosecutor who (a) knowingly allows the case to be set for trial without disclosing that a necessary witness would be unavailable; (b) files a motion solely for delay knowing it frivolous; (c) makes a false material statement to obtain a continuance; or (d) willfully fails to proceed to trial without justification may be punished by: a fine not exceeding ₱20,000 (private counsel); a fine not exceeding ₱5,000 (counsel de oficio, public attorney, prosecutor); and denial of the right to practice before the court for up to 30 days — without prejudice to criminal or other sanctions.`,
			plain: `Lawyers who cause delay by deception or frivolous motions can be fined or barred from that court for up to 30 days.`,
			hypo: `Defense counsel files a motion to inhibit on a fabricated ground solely to delay. The court may fine him up to ₱20,000 and bar him for up to 30 days.`

			n: '9',
			title: 'Remedy where accused is not brought to trial within the time limit',
			text: `If the accused is not brought to trial within the time limit (Rule 116, Sec. 1[g] and Sec. 1 of this Rule as extended), the information may be dismissed on motion of the accused for denial of speedy trial. The accused has the burden of proving the motion; the prosecution has the burden of going forward with evidence of excluded time. "The dismissal shall be subject to the rules on double jeopardy." Failure of the accused to move for dismissal prior to trial is a waiver of the right to dismiss under this section.`,
			plain: `Move to dismiss before trial; the dismissal counts as an acquittal.`,
			when: `Before trial.`,
			effect: `Dismissal bars reprosecution (equivalent to acquittal) even though on the accused's motion.`,
			hypo: `The accused moves to dismiss on day 100 after receiving the pre-trial order, no trial having started and no excluded delays shown. Dismissal is proper and bars refiling.`,
			trap: `This statutory remedy is waived if not raised before trial; but a constitutional speedy-trial claim (Sec. 10) can still be made for oppressive delay during trial.`
		},
		{
			n: '10',
			title: 'Law on speedy trial not a bar to provision on speedy trial in the Constitution',
			text: `No provision of law on speedy trial and no implementing rule shall be interpreted as a bar to any charge of denial of the right to speedy trial guaranteed by Art. III, Sec. 14(2) of the Constitution.`,
			plain: `The Speedy Trial Act sets floors, not ceilings; the constitutional right stands on its own.`,
			hypo: `Delays technically excluded under Sec. 3 may still, taken together and if vexatious, violate the constitutional right.`
		},
		{
			n: '11',
			title: 'Order of trial',
			text: `(a) The prosecution presents evidence to prove the charge and, in the proper case, the civil liability. (b) The accused may present evidence to prove his defense and damages, if any, from a provisional remedy. (c) The prosecution and defense may, in that order, present rebuttal and sur-rebuttal evidence, unless the court permits additional evidence on the main issue. (d) Upon admission of evidence, the case is deemed submitted for decision unless the court directs oral argument or memoranda. (e) "When the accused admits the act or omission charged in the complaint or information but interposes a lawful defense, the order of trial may be modified."`,
			plain: `Prosecution → defense → rebuttal → sur-rebuttal → submission. Reverse trial if the accused admits the act but claims a defense.`,
			effect: `Memoranda, when required, do not suspend the period to promulgate (2017 Guidelines: discretionary, max 25 pages).`,
			hypo: `The accused admits shooting the victim but claims defense of a relative. The court may let the defense present first.`
		},
		{
			n: '12',
			title: 'Application for examination of witness for accused before trial',
			text: `When the accused has been held to answer, he may, on motion with notice, have witnesses conditionally examined. The motion states (a) the name and residence of the witness; (b) the substance of his testimony; and (c) that the witness is sick or infirm such that he will not be able to attend trial, or resides more than 100 km from the place of trial and has no means to attend, or similar circumstances make him unavailable. It is supported by the accused's affidavit and other evidence the court requires.`,
			plain: `The defense can take a witness's testimony early if he may be unable to attend trial.`,
			reqs: `Motion with notice; contents (a)–(c); affidavit of the accused.`,
			hypo: `A defense witness is about to undergo surgery abroad. The accused moves for conditional examination, stating his name, residence and expected testimony.`
		},
		{
			n: '13',
			title: 'Examination of defense witness; how made',
			text: `If satisfied, the court orders the examination at a specified date, time and place, serving the prosecutor a copy at least three days before. It is taken before a judge, or if not practicable, a member of the Bar in good standing designated by the judge, or if ordered by a superior court, before an inferior court designated. It proceeds even if the prosecutor, duly notified, is absent. A written record is taken.`,
			plain: `Before any judge or a designated lawyer; prosecutor notified 3 days ahead.`,
			when: `Order served on the prosecutor at least 3 days before.`,
			hypo: `The examination is taken before a designated lawyer in the witness's province; the prosecutor, notified, does not appear. It proceeds.`

			n: '14',
			title: 'Bail to secure appearance of material witness',
			text: `When the court is satisfied, upon proof or oath, that a material witness will not testify when required, it may, on motion of either party, order the witness to post bail; upon refusal, the court shall commit him to prison until he complies or is legally discharged after testifying.`,
			plain: `A material witness likely to skip may be required to post bail — or be jailed until he testifies.`,
			hypo: `The key eyewitness has told neighbors he will leave town to avoid testifying. On the prosecution's motion, the court orders him to post bail; he refuses and is committed until he testifies.`,
			trap: `Bail here does not require prior custody.`
		},
		{
			n: '15',
			title: 'Examination of witness for the prosecution',
			text: `When a prosecution witness is too sick or infirm to appear at trial, or has to leave the Philippines with no definite date of returning, he may forthwith be conditionally examined before the court where the case is pending, in the presence of the accused (or in his absence after reasonable notice), in the same manner as at trial. The accused's failure or refusal to attend after notice is a waiver. The statement may be admitted for or against the accused.`,
			plain: `Prosecution witnesses about to become unavailable testify early — but only before the trial court, with the accused notified.`,
			cases: `${caseLink('manguerra', 'Manguerra v. Risos (2008)')} — must be before the court where the case is pending; civil depositions (Rule 23) do not apply.`,
			hypo: `A prosecution witness is emigrating next month. She is examined before the trial court with the accused present and cross-examining.`,

			title: 'Trial of several accused',
			text: `When two or more accused are jointly charged, they shall be tried jointly unless the court, in its discretion and on motion of the prosecutor or any accused, orders separate trial for one or more.`,

			title: 'Discharge of accused to be state witness',
			text: `When two or more persons are jointly charged, upon motion of the prosecution before resting its case, the court may direct one or more accused to be discharged with their consent to be state witnesses when, after requiring the prosecution to present evidence and each proposed state witness's sworn statement at a hearing, the court is satisfied that: (a) there is absolute necessity for the testimony; (b) there is no other direct evidence available except his testimony; (c) his testimony can be substantially corroborated in its material points; (d) he does not appear to be the most guilty; and (e) he has not at any time been convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude. Evidence adduced in support of the discharge automatically forms part of the trial. If the motion is denied, his sworn statement is inadmissible.`,
			plain: `To turn a co-accused into a State witness: joint charge, prosecution motion before it rests, his consent, a hearing, and five conditions.`,
			reqs: `Procedural: two or more jointly charged; prosecution\'s motion before resting; consent of the accused; hearing with evidence and sworn statement. Substantive: the five conditions (a)–(e).`,
			who: `Prosecution (moves); court (decides); accused to be discharged (consents).`,
			when: `Before the prosecution rests its case.`,
			effect: `Granted: acquittal (Sec. 18). Denied: he is tried with the others; his sworn statement is inadmissible.`,
			cases: `${caseLink('salvanera', 'Salvanera v. People (2007)')}; ${caseLink('anabe', 'People v. Anabe (2010)')}; <i>Jimenez v. People</i> (2014 — "not the most guilty," not "least guilty"); <i>People v. Sandiganbayan</i> and ${caseLink('ampatuan-de-lima', 'Ampatuan v. De Lima (2013)')} (deference to the prosecution).`,
			hypo: `Three accused in a kidnapping; the driver, who never touched the victim and has no prior conviction, is the only one who can describe the planning meeting. The prosecution moves before resting for his discharge. If his account is corroborated by phone records and the ransom trail, the court may discharge him.`,
			trap: `"Not the most guilty" — not "least guilty." And the corroboration requirement is relaxed when the state witness is an eyewitness whose testimony is direct evidence (Anabe).`

			n: '18',
			title: 'Discharge of accused operates as acquittal',
			text: `"The order indicated in the preceding section shall amount to an acquittal of the discharged accused and shall be a bar to future prosecution for the same offense, unless the accused fails or refuses to testify against his co-accused in accordance with his sworn statement constituting the basis for the discharge."`,
			plain: `Discharge = acquittal, unless he backs out of testifying.`,
			effect: `Double jeopardy bars reprosecution — subject to his testifying as promised (Bogo-Medellin Milling v. Son, in Tiu). Tiu (citing Prof. Salvador) advises that he be arraigned first so jeopardy attaches.`,
			hypo: `The discharged accused testifies but later recants on cross. If he failed to testify "in accordance with his sworn statement," the State may prosecute him.`

			n: '19',
			title: 'When mistake has been made in charging the proper offense',
			text: `When it becomes manifest at any time before judgment that a mistake has been made in charging the proper offense and the accused cannot be convicted of the offense charged or any offense necessarily included in it, the accused shall not be discharged if there appears good cause to detain him; the court shall commit him to answer for the proper offense and dismiss the original case upon the filing of the proper information.`,
			plain: `Wrong offense charged? Hold the accused (if there is cause), require the right information, then dismiss the old one.`,
			reqs: `(1) Mistake in charging the proper offense; (2) manifest before judgment; (3) accused cannot be convicted of the offense charged or an included offense.`,
			effect: `Substitution under Rule 110, Sec. 14; no double jeopardy because the offenses differ.`,
			hypo: `During trial for theft, evidence shows the accused, an employee entrusted with collections, misappropriated them (estafa). The court requires an estafa information and dismisses the theft case on its filing.`

			n: '20',
			title: 'Appointment of acting prosecutor',
			text: `When a prosecutor, assistant or deputy is disqualified under Rule 137, Sec. 1 or for other reasons, the judge or the prosecutor shall communicate with the Secretary of Justice to appoint an acting prosecutor.`,
			plain: `If the prosecutor is disqualified, the Secretary of Justice appoints a replacement.`,
			hypo: `The assigned prosecutor is the complainant's brother. The court communicates with the Secretary of Justice for an acting prosecutor.`
		},
		{
			n: '21',
			title: 'Exclusion of the public',
			text: `The judge may, motu proprio, exclude the public if the evidence is offensive to decency or public morals; he may also, on motion of the accused, exclude the public, except court personnel and the parties' counsel.`,
			plain: `Closed hearings for indecent evidence (court's own motion) or at the accused's request.`,
			hypo: `In a rape trial involving explicit testimony, the judge excludes the public on his own initiative.`,

"When the demurrer to evidence is filed without leave of court, the accused waives the right to present evidence and submits the case for judgment on the basis of the evidence for the prosecution." The motion for leave must state its grounds and be filed within five days (non-extendible) after the prosecution rests; the prosecution may oppose within five days. If leave is granted, the demurrer is filed within ten days from notice; the prosecution may oppose within ten days.
