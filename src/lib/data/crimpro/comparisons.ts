	reqs: ['Motion specifying the defect.', 'Showing that, hypothetically admitting the facts alleged, no offense is charged, or that the court lacks jurisdiction.'],
	time: ['Waived if not raised before plea.', 'Not waived (Rule 117, Sec. 9).'],

	effect: ['Cured by amendment (before plea freely; after plea, formal only with leave) or by evidence at trial.', 'No valid conviction can rest on it; quashal or dismissal; refiling allowed unless (g) or (i).'],
	trap: ['Calling a wrong caption fatal (the body controls).', 'Calling lack of authority of the filing officer "substantive/jurisdictional" (it is waivable — Villa Gomez).'],
	decisive: 'Whether the defect prevents the information from charging an offense within the court\'s jurisdiction (substantive, non-waivable) or only affects how the charge is stated (formal, waivable and curable).',
	hypo: 'An information for theft misstates the date by a week and omits the provision violated (formal — no effect if not objected to). Another fails to allege that the property belonged to another (substantive — no offense charged; quashable even after plea, though the prosecution may first amend).'
